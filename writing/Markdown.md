# Markdown
Markdown is amazing and such an awesome way to format the text you write.

I am using most of the features from it where appropriate. However in my GitHub repositories I like to mix in a little HTML mostly for cantering things like headings, images and images because I have a thing for centred content for some reason. And with macros adding these HTML blocks is as fast as adding a markdown header for me.

## Notes
- You can use relative paths in markdown links
	- you can also link to headings inside the document with `#..`
- Don't add extra space after heading as it is unnecessary  
 - In referencing titles to jump to in README, lowercase them (`i.e. [Contributing](#contributing)`)
