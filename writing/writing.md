# Writing
I love writing. Human language, of which I currently know two so far: russian and english.

Is incredibly empowering. The sheer fact that I can actually put my thoughts onto paper in a way that other people can read and understand is amazing.

Paul Graham wrote a wonderful article titled [_Write like you talk_](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html) and I agree with it wholeheartedly. In my opinion these are main pillars on which I try to build my writing skills upon.

## Honesty
If I don't believe in what I am saying, it is waste of both mine and the person's reading my work time. If I believe in what idea or message or thought that it is I am trying to say, writing becomes second instinct and it is much easier to translate what is in head onto paper. Being honest with yourself may sometimes be difficult but [journalling](../life/journalling.md) often helps in this regard.

## Saying more with less
_Never use a long word where a short one will do._

I try to have my writing be as transparent as possible for the person reading it. If something can be said simply, it is best to say it, simply.

## Read
Read other people's work. Read books. Both fiction and non fiction, and get a taste to how different styles of writing can exist and how they can be used effectively.

## Don't use filler words
Always be consious when I am writing something and try to focus on the message and remove as much fluff as possible. Words like 'really' have no place in writing as they only undermine what you said before.

## Be aware of pacing
Be aware of pacing between words and sentences. The sententes ideally should flow into one another. Breaks in form of commas and full steps are important. As they allow for the reader to take a break and absorb the point that you tried to deliver.

## Knowing what to write next
I keep a private Trello board where I drop ideas I have of what I want to write next. Then I set due dates for articles I want to write and start working on them. Most often it is the simple act of starting to write something that makes something I can actually publish that I like. Here is how my Trello board looks:

## Notes
- Most adverbs are superfluous. Most cases where you say "generally" or "usually" you're undermining your point and the use of "very", "extremely", etc. are hyperbolic and breathless and make it easier to regard what you're writing as unserious.
- Examine every word: a surprising number don’t serve any purpose.
- Examine every word: a surprising number don’t serve any purpose.
- Prune out “a bit,” “a little,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much.”
