# Writing prompts

There is a cool thing on the internet called writing prompts where you are given some words that you can then make a story out of. There is even a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/) where people share these writing prompts and you can see what other people wrote as a response to them.

I never answered any of these prompts but I hope to try flex my creative writing muscles one day. Here is a neat writing prompt I did like from it though:

> You are on your death bed, surrounded by family and loved ones, reflecting on a life well lived. You've lived a long, successful life, and you feel at peace as you look on at your posterity... As you pass on from this this world, you find yourself waking up, surrounded by aliens. One of them asks, "how was the trip, man?"
