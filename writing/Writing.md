# Writing
I love writing. Human language, of which I currently know two so far : russian and english. Is incredibly empowering. The sheer fact that I can actually put my thoughts onto paper in a way that other people can read and understand is amazing. 

Paul Graham wrote a wonderful article titled [_Write like you talk_](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html) and I agree with it wholeheartedly. In my opinion these are main pillars on which I try to build my writing skills upon.

## Honesty
If I don't believe in what I am saying, it is waste of both mine and the person's reading my work time. If I believe in what idea or message or thought that it is I am trying to say, writing becomes second instinct and it is much easier to translate what is in head onto paper. Being honest with yourself may sometimes be difficult but [journalling](../journalling/Journalling.md) often helps in this regard.


## Saying more with less
_Never use a long word where a short one will do._

I try to have my writing be as transparent as possible for the person reading it. If something can be said simply, it is best to say it, simply. 

## Read
Read other people's work. Read books. Both fiction and non fiction, and get a taste to how different styles of writing can exist and how they can be used effectively.
