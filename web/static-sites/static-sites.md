# Static sites

I love using [Hugo](hugo.md) for generating static websites. I then use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the sites for free.

## Notes

- [If you've got a static site with a scrollable sidebar, it really helps to memorize the scroll position across page loads.](https://twitter.com/hakimel/status/1262337065670316033)
