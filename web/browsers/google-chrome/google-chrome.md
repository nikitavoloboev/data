# [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
I use this browser only for web development. Still learning it's dev tools. [Here](https://github.com/learn-anything/chrome-extensions#readme) are some chrome extensions I use and like.

I use [Morpheon Dark](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/morpheon-dark/mafbdhjdkjnoafhfelkjpchpaepjknad) theme.
