# [Stylus](https://userstyles.org)

I prefer to use darker interfaces on websites during evenings. So I change the looks of many websites with Stylus.

I use [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app) Safari Extension to change the looks of the sites I use to have darker colors in cases where sites don't have them as default. The extension also lets you import any of [Stylish themes](https://userstyles.org) to it.

I use Chrome only for webdev and I use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#readme) there instead of Stylish as the latter [collects websites you visit](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/).

Below are themes I like using:

Even though I prefer using [Dictionary app](https://wokabulary.com/blog/the-built-in-dictionary-on-mac-and-iphone.html) I also use [WikiWand](http://www.wikiwand.com) extension for the web which has dark mode:

In the cases where there doesn’t exist a Stylus theme for a website, I sometimes use [Nightlight Safari extension](https://gofake1.net/projects/nightlight.html) to have all websites have night mode with a toggle on/off switch. It works surprisingly well and helps when using the internet at night.
