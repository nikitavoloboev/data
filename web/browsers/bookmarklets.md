## Bookmarklets I use
- [Go to first commit of currently open repo](https://gist.github.com/ada36ad5c440246c60c2833308c2cf1d)
- [Online article discussion finder](https://github.com/theoretick/discuss-it) - Lets you see where the link you are watching right now has been discussed before.

# Notes
- You can add bookmarklets in Safari either by:
	1. Dragging a bookmarklet from a webpage to your bookmarks bar then moving it from there.
	2. Creating a random bookmark, then editing it and changing the URL to the bookmarklet JavaScript.
