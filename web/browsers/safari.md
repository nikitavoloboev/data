# [Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/)
My favourite browser for many reasons. It is incredibly fast, doesn't have the baggage of all the Google Chrome tracking and is native to macOS so it is extremely optimised.

## Safari power using
As it is my most used app, I like to script and automate as much of my use of it as possible.

I open any of my most used websites using [these KM macros](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/blob/master/km-macros/macros/global/w:%20Open%20websites%20(Safari).kmmacros). The macro opens the website I specify or if the website is open anywhere in Safari and will jump between the tabs of the website. I use this macro for pretty much all websites out there and that means I can open any website I wish with a single keypress. Both open and switch between various websites.

Aside from it, I use [many Safari extensions](https://github.com/learn-anything/safari-extensions#readme). Most notably I really love and recommend using [sVim](https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim). My configuration for it can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/c26e6a05e4e426e0542e55b7513b581c).

I also use [this amazing workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant) to quickly jump between my currently active Safari tabs as well as search through my history and my bookmarks.

If I get too many tabs open filled with things to read and do, I sometimes save a session of all these tabs in [Sessions safari extension](https://sessions-extension.github.io/Sessions/) and then have a clean Safari window to focus on.

I then schedule times where I go and review these saved sessions.
