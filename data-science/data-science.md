# Data Science
## Notes
- [If you can solve a problem with a simple heuristic, do that. Sometimes you don't need machine learning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/

- Data is not always useful and it doesn't matter how much of it you have.
 There’s no mathematical tool to tell you if your hypothesis is true; you can only see whether it is consistent with the data, and if the data is sparse or unclear, your conclusions are uncertain.
