# Wiki reference
Since I am both releasing this wiki for other people to read and explore as well as for my own use. I have a small number of _rules_ of things I follow.

If you stumble upon anything confusing in the wiki, this place should ideally clear up any question you had.

## Abbreviations
I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean:
- LA = [Learn Anything](../projects/learn-anything.md)
- KM = [Keyboard Maestro](../macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro.md). Will often reference KM macros I made.
- repo = GitHub repository

## Years
I often add a year in brackets to some articles or talks like __(2017)__ which stands for the year in which that article or talk was given in.

## Karabiner
I may say things like `bound to v + r` which means that I created an action that activates when I hold `v` key and then press `r`. For how that works read [this](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md).
