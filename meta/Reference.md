# Wiki reference
Since I am both releasing this wiki for other people to read and explore as well as for my own use. I have a small number of _rules_ of things I follow. If you stumble upon anything confusing in the wiki, this place should ideally clear up any question you had.

## Abbreviations
I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean : 
- LA = [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) (will often link to a map from there for learning some topic)
- km = [Keyboard Maestro](../macOS/apps/km/km.md)
- repo = GitHub repository

## Emojis
Instead of writing `TODO:` across this wiki, I use 📌 emoji to mean the same thing. So if you see something with 📌 next to it, just dismiss it as it is for my own personal use and reference.

## GitHub Gists
As I embed a lot of code in these wiki as gists. I use `{}` to signify user input in these Gists. [Here](https://gist.github.com/17a9bc95ce5da0db7f85d076b45d07cd) is an example of one such gist. There `{dir}` means that a directory name is the user command that is missing.

## Years
I often add a year in brackets to some articles or talks like `(2017)` which stands for the year in which that article or talk was given in.

## Karabiner mappings
I may often say something like `which I binded to a + k` which means I binded some action with Karabiner to `a` modifier key held down + k. For what means, you can read [this](../macOS/apps/karabiner/Karabiner.md).
