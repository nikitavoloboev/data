# Wiki reference
Since I am both releasing this wiki for other people to read and explore as well as for my own use. I have a small number of _rules_ of things I follow. If you stumble upon anything confusing in the wiki, this place should ideally clear up any question you had.

## Abbreviations
I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean: 
- LA = [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz)
- KM = [Keyboard Maestro](../macOS/apps/km/km.md)
- repo = GitHub repository

## Years
I often add a year in brackets to some articles or talks like `(2017)` which stands for the year in which that article or talk was given in.

## Actions
I will sometimes leave off `TODO: ` statements throughout the wiki. This won't happen often but this is to remind myself to do something about a particular thing. You can ignore them.
