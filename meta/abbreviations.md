# Abbreviations 🔖

I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean : 

- LA = [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) (will often link to a map there for learning some topic)

# Prefixes

I also can prefix certain things with a year, like in [talks](../talks/Talks.md) which stand for they year in which the article or book was made in.
