# Wiki Structure
Below you will find all the notes I have made. I continuously update them and I use them myself for my own reference. However I try to write things and structure them so everyone can benefit from reading them or even reference what I know easily and quickly.

Each folder is a topic that can include other topics under it related to the parent topic.

[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) provides a pretty awesome search feature that lets you search across this entire knowledge base, so feel free to use it.

I also really love using night mode. You can switch to it from here if you haven't :

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, you can just start reading from the top entry down and see what sparks your interest. The top folders include content that is often changing which includes [projects](../projects/Projects.md) I am working on, [things I am working on right now](../working-on/working-on.md), things I am [learning](../working-on/Learning.md) and [reading](../working-on/Reading.md) and [some ideas](../working-on/Ideas.md) I have that I don't have time or skill to work on. 

I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in-between.

For super fast access of this wiki, I do advise you to try out [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).

If you find some mistake, especially if something that I say is plain wrong, please fork [this repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) and make a PR with correct changes. Or [open an issue](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/issues/new) saying what you think is wrong.

## Content Structure
Each topic will have a title, some description of it, usually my own thoughts and knowledge on it as well as referencing some resources or links I have liked or used that helped me either understand the topic or gain appreciation of it.

The structure of each of the posts will often look roughly like this : 
1. Title
2. Description
	- my thoughts on the topic
3. Subtopics 
	- various subtopics related to the main topic
4. Snippets
	- if the topic is programming related, I will attach a few Gists related to the topic I personally use
5. Links
	- links related to the topic
6. Notes
	- my own personal notes on the matter as well as things I found interesting on the internet regarding the topic
		- I often give a link of where I got things from

In links I very often link to a  [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) map as that in my opinion is the perfect place to start learning any topic as it should ideally show you the most efficient path for learning anything. Aside from the link to LA, I may also include some of my own things I wrote or really liked as well as my comments on these links.

Aside from this wiki, I also share various mind maps I have made for myself and you can read more about it [here](./my-mind.md).

If you are interested in how I maintain and write this wiki, I wrote about it in detail [here](../other/wiki-workflow.md).
