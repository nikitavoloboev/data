# Focusing

Focusing on things I need to be doing is often hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

I define a set of [rules](rules.md) and [processes](processes.md) I set for myself to follow. The rules act as a framework for how I lead my life.

## Focusing on what's important

I keep a private Trello board where I outline goals & projects I want to focus on.

I mark projects and goals I want to focus on **right now**, and by pressing `Q` in Trello I only see these cards on the board.

I use the same `Focus on cards` approach for all my [other Trello boards](../sharing/my-trello.md) too.

I then [schedule events](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md) in my calendar and plan the day/week in context of my goals.

I use [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md)'s recurring scheduled tasks as a way to remember to complete my day/week reflections & plans.

This goal centric approach is useful as it allows me to keep focused on what I want to achieve by limiting number of projects/goals I am working on at any given time.

I then use & build tools to make the process of achieving the goals & tasks more streamlined.

## Focus sessions

I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) as a recurring [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which lets me work in sessions of 80 minutes with 10 min breaks by blocking [distracting websites](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/57340528a6dfb3eb498dce647ed6841f) and apps.

Only on breaks can I visit these websites. I also get 20 minutes of optional break time every 3 hours. And I can start 5 min breaks during my Focus sessions with a [macro](../macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros.md).

The things I work on are defined by events I have set in [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md). The events can be meetings or projects I have set.

If no event is set, by default it means I go through [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) and work on most prioritized tasks for `Today` or `Starred`.

Other events include:

- Code (💻) - I work through 2Do tasks with `pr` tag or build an idea from [Trello](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP).
- Learn (📖) - I learn a topic from one of the currently active topics on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q).
- Write (🖊) - I write and finish any of the [fragments](../fragments/fragments.md) I started.

At the end of the 80 min focus session, [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) shows up automatically and I say which projects I worked on in this 80 min period.

> Focus script ran on break/focus-end will switch to Timing and activate next block of time so I can annotate what I did

> Projects in Timing track activities I did. I add rules to each activity so Timing intelligently matches blocks of time to activities

I limit apps that can send me notifications to only essential things and turn off all sounds on notifications I get.

I focus on [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) & limit any distractions. I follow [rules](rules.md#focus) to maintain my focus throughout the day.

I support my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) by working on projects that I care about and looking after my [health](../health/health.md).

## Notes

- You can't manage projects. You can only manage actions related to projects.
- [Brains aren’t for holding info, they’re for thinking. So if you can empty your brain out by writing stuff onto a todo list, onto your calendar, etc, your brain will have more space for the high level stuff that’s a bit harder to get on paper. And if you wrote down “do thing” on the todo-list… well you just have to do the thing afterwards. There’s nothing to think about or redigest if you write out the things in more detail](https://lobste.rs/s/0qlkm7/how_do_i_keep_multiple_projects_my_head)
