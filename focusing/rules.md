## Ideas

- Share [all ideas I have](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP). Add relevant description and links to describe the idea clearly.
- Start building early. Validate ideas. Iterate fast. Ship often. Listen to feedback.
- Look for patterns to draw inspiration for novel ideas.

## Learn

- Always learn new things but be purposeful & focused. Learn [fundamentals](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/the-root-of-it-all-9b6ab6a77e1d) for clarity.
- Document everything. Don't repeat things. Link instead.
- There are no dumb questions. Do some research first though.
- [Build things from scratch](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/build-to-learn) to understand. Minimal version that works.
- Draw or sketch to distill complex ideas. Think through problems together. Discuss.

- Use imperative tense for briefness when making tasks (2Do, Trello, GitHub issues). Add useful details where needed.
- Remove unnecessary and [filler words](../writing/writing.md#dont-use). Use adverbs sparingly, they often undermine your point. Instead of `really like`, say `love`. Say more with less.
- Minimize use of articles (`a`, `an`, `the`) as they in most cases add noise.
- Hyperlink words/phrases appropriately.
- Use headings to separate sections in articles/docs.
- Fix mistakes with spell checker.
