# Processes

Some simple processes to follow when doing things.

## Learn

1. Find what I want/need to learn. Ideally in context of a problem I want to solve.
2. Read about it on wiki. Find the topic on [Learn Anything](../ideas/learn-anything.md) and learn from best resources for deeper knowledge.
3. Ask myself why it is the way it is. Ask myself what am I missing and what I don't understand (tackle each dependency one by one).

## Make Alfred workflow

1. Follow [making workflows outline](../macOS/apps/alfred/making-workflows.md).
2. Share it. Post the workflow on [Alfred Forum](https://www.alfredforum.com/). Heading (36 pt), `Code | Download` (22 pt) on the bottom. [Example](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/10486-ask-create-share).

## Write an article

1. Write down main ideas I want to cover as bullet points.
2. Write the article touching on all the main points.
3. Refactor. Remove useless words and irrelevant pieces.
4. Publish.

2. Write the book. Refactor continuously.
