# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track any new habits I want to add to my life. If any of the habits get 60 consecutive repetitions, I mark the habit as `learned` and focus on new habits I want to add to my life.

## Learned habits

- No sugary drinks. (2017)
- Track all time in [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md). (2018)
- Take Vitamin B12 & D3 in morning. (2018 June)
- No complaining (2018 July)

## Current habits

Which I will probably keep for life.

## Morning routine

I use [Siri Shortcuts](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#shortcuts) for my Morning and Night routines.

My morning routine starts off by playing a song I love from my favorite artist Nils Frahm. [La](https://open.spotify.com/track/29p8XJUPeeS3t9XwJt69g0).

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
