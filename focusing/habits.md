# Habits

I once used [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track my essential life habits.

The 6 habits are an essential subset of more general [rules](rules.md) I want to follow in life. I don't use the app any more as these habits are fully ingrained into my lifestyle.

## Habits described

`Sleep 8 hours` is autofilled through my health data.

`Cardio / Weights` is autofilled through my health data. It includes workout minutes from running/cycling & bodyweight/lifting workouts. Bodyweight/lifting is tracked with [Strong](https://strong.app) & [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) apps. It also includes yoga (tracked with [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com)).

`Activity rings` is autofilled through my health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Nutritious Plants | Water` is marked as done when I drank only water/tea/coffee (no added sugar) & ate only [nutritious whole foods (nuts/veggies/fruits)](../health/nutrition/foods.md) with focus on completing my micro & macro nutrient goals. It includes consuming my [daily supplements](../health/nutrition/supplements.md).

`Impact | Simplify | Calm` is marked as done when I felt my work was impactful towards my goals. All of my values and rules were held. I further simplified things and cut out noise from my life to focus on creating and capturing value. It also means I was calm and mindful throughout the day. No anxieties and no inhibitions.

`Focus | Make/Learn` is marked as done when I didn't get distracted from tasks I assigned myself to do & worked on [one task at a time](../research/solving-problems.md). I spent the time making things (ideas/art/..) & learning.

## Building new habits (rules)

Nowadays I learn new habits proactively by building systems and thought processes that lead me in [directions](../focusing/goals.md) I want to go. Everything is built around refined [rules](../focusing/rules.md) & [processes](../focusing/processes.md).

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
