# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track any new habits I want to add to my life. If any of the habits get 100 consecutive repetitions, I mark the habit as `learned` and focus on new habits I want to add to my life.

I also keep top habits/[rules](rules.md) I try to follow through in life on display in my [Focus board](focusing.md).

## Morning routine

I use [Siri Shortcuts](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#shortcuts) for my Morning and Night routines.

## Other habits

Activity rings & Training are autofilled for me from Apple health data. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals. Training minutes are set to amount of minutes I worked out with [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) which includes some bodyweight exercises I like doing.

`Focus | One task at a time` is pretty self explanatory. This is marked as done if I feel like I haven't derailed my focus throughout the day and did what I was supposed to do at ideally all points in time throughout the day. For `One task at a time`, [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) goes over strategies I use to achieve this.

`Event driven | Plan ahead` is mostly about setting events to achieve my goals (set in [Focus board](../focusing/focusing.md)) & going through with them. Event driven also means being open to change of plans in light of new insights.

`Water/tea | no sugar` is marked as done when I drank no drink that has sugar added to it. I try to drink only water & tea with occasional coffee.

`Eat plants | whole food` is marked as done when I followed through with my [whole food plant based diet](../health/nutrition/nutrition.md).

`Daily mix | Track | Fast 16` is marked as done when I ate [my daily mix](../health/nutrition/foods.md) (set of foods I try to eat at minimum every day). Track means tracking the food I eat. And `Fast 16` means doing [intermittent fasting](../health/nutrition/fasting.md) so I can eat only in the 8 hour time slot each day. I also fast whole day on Friday.

`12H Ideas/Learn` is marked as done when I spent at least 12 hours of my day on activities I find most useful to my life, ideas & learning. Ideas is a rather broad term and includes all projects I care about completing. I track all time in [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) which lets me see where I really spend my time & adjust accordingly.

`Mindful, calm & happy` is quite self explanatory. Fortunately this one is the easiest one for me to complete but I still like to keep it as a habit to remind myself of this rather simple but powerful habit.

`Good day | Timing & habits` is marked only when all the other 11 habits are marked as complete & when I am happy with how I spent my day. No useless news & distractions.

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
