# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track my essential life habits. There are 12 of them & I want to complete them all for a perfect day.

I also keep top habits I try to follow through in life on display in my [Focus board](focusing.md). And I try to follow some [rules](rules.md) I set for myself.

## Habits described

`Sleep 8 hours` is autofilled through my health data.

`In bed before 23:00` is autofilled through my health data.

`Activity rings` is autofilled through my health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Workout / Cardio` is autofilled through my health data. It includes workout minutes from running/cycling & bodyweight/lifting workouts. Bodyweight/lifting is tracked with [Strong](https://strong.app) & [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) apps. It also includes yoga (tracked with [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com)).

`Wake up fast | Good spine` is marked as done when I spent no time wasted in bed with my phone and I started the day off by waking up and doing a workout or starting my day with work. I try use my bed only for sleep.

`Water | Food Mix | Wholefood` is marked as done when I drank only water/tea (no added sugar in anything). Occasional coffee is fine. And when I eat only wholefood foods (nuts/veggies/fruits). No foods that came from killing an animal.

`Set goals | Plan | Execute` is marked as done when I spent time moving towards the [goals I've set](../focusing/focusing.md). Executing means not being distracted by external world and stimuli.

`Share | Write | Be honest` is marked as done when I have shared my thoughts/experiences freely and honestly. Sharing things I've learned by writing them down and sharing it. And finally broadening my life by meeting new people.

`No wasted time | Build ideas` is marked as done when I haven't spent any time unmindful on things that bring no value to my life. Essentially it means doing things proactively rather than reactively and thus no time should be wasted no matter the distractions. Filter input, maximize output. I can check where my time is really being spent using tools like [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) & iOS Screen Time.

`Focus | One task at a time` is marked as done when I haven't derailed my focus throughout the day and did what I was supposed to do at ideally all points in time throughout the day. [Solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) & [focusing](../focusing/focusing.md) goes over strategies I use to achieve this habit.

`Mindful, calm & happy` is marked as done I spent a day being mindful of my thoughts & feelings and approaching any new thing with calmness and clarity. Whilst being happy with the fortune that is life.

`Good day` is marked only when all the other 11 habits are marked as complete & when I am happy with how I spent my day.

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
