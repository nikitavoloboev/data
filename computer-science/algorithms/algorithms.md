# Algorithms

## Interesting algorithms

- [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) - [How it works?](http://qr.ae/TUpCVB)

## Notes

- Mocking up the problem on paper or white board is crucial.
- The functionality of a hash table can be extrapolated and used to solve many problems at the cost of efficiency.
- Arrays can be used to back most higher level data structures. Sometimes a “data structure” is no more than some clever math for accessing locations in an array.
