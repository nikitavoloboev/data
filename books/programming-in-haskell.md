# Programming in Haskell
## Foreword
- Adding recursion in the form of feedback-loops to pure combinational circuits lets us implement mutable state via flip-flops.
- True value of functional programming lies in leveraging first-class functions to achieve compositionality and equational reasoning.

## Part 1 - basic concepts
- Functional programming can be viewed as a style of programming in which the basic method of computation is the application of functions to arguments.
- Functional programming language is one that supports and encourages the functional style.
