# Books
I love reading new books and making notes on things I've read and learned from the books I read.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/MOrnm2aN) of books I am reading and want to read.

I also track the books I have read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/15768482?shelf=read) and below.

## Books read
I make notes on all the books I have read. Below are the books I have read or started to read sorted by the year I read (or started reading) the books in.
