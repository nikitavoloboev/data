# Books
I have not read many books but from the ones I have read I really liked [Master and Margarita](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117833.The_Master_and_Margarita).

You can see the books I am reading or plan to read soon [here](../working-on/Reading.md).

## Books read
I track all the books I have read [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/15768482?shelf=read). 

I also make notes on all the books I have read. Below are the books I have covered thus far sorted by the year I read (or started reading) the books in. If there is a review next to the book, that means I have read it.
