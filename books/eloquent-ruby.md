# Eloquent ruby
## Chapter 1 - write code that looks like ruby
- code should be crystal clear - good code tells the reader exactly what it is trying to do.
	- Great code shouts its intent. 
- Since there is a limit to how much information you can keep in your head at any given moment, good code is not just clear, it is also concise. 
	- It’s much easier to understand what a method or a class is doing if you can take it all in at a glance.
- If it’s obvious how someone would use your method—if the class or program needs no explanation—then don’t explain it. 
- The danger in comments that explain how the code works is that they can easily slide off into the worst reason for adding comments: to make a badly written program somewhat comprehensible. 
	- Is there anything you can do to let the code speak for itself instead of needing subtitles?
	- Remember, good code is like a good joke: It needs no explanation.
