# Ego

Ego is who I am. Without ego, there is no I.

PsychonautWiki describes [ego death as memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Memory_suppression&_=#Ego_death). And it's an interesting way to look at it and I think it is true. Without your memory, there is no you.

In my thoughts, everything is dependent on perspective and many of the experiences we have are experienced through the perspective of our ego. If we take that away, we get completely new experience that we were not able to experience prior.

Similar to how switching of channels in a radio works, perhaps we can tune into different frequencies of consciousness. In any way, it's quite hard to put these concepts into words, if not impossible.

## Notes

- [According to Buddhism, birth and death are both illusions of the self or the ego](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/6i7d2r/sowe_dont_really_die_do_we/)
- [The value of ego loss is primarily in self analysis. The social constructs that normally limit your thinking, and beliefs, are lifted. It allows for a free flow of thought that can only be attributed to your being. At least that's my thought behind it. I primarily use psychedelics as a learning tool, not expecting to learn anything larger about the world or universe, just hoping to learn more about myself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8d7d1j/so_whats_the_actual_point_of_ego_death/)
- [Ego death is a sudden realization of your eternal nature.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8d7d1j/so_whats_the_actual_point_of_ego_death/)
- [One way to compare them would be that nn dmt is an immersive visual experience but there is still a perceiver of events as there is a duality between subject and object, eg seeing entities that are perceived to be separate from the self, 5 meo dmt induces complete ego death where there is no longer even a perciever of events, all boundaries disappear and your awareness becomes infinite. This is why people believe that you become God on a 5 meo breakthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/9ssa0g/dmt_vs_5meo_dmt/)
