# Video

I share [all the YouTube channels I follow](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/d7d179271bc2f63f02f6b24b29c307bb) and all [YouTube playlists I made](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw/playlists?view=1&sort=lad&flow=grid) (all but [Good Music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) are outdated).

[Descript](https://www.descript.com/) is amazing for video/sound editing. [Cloudflare Video is great for hosting videos](https://twitter.com/elithrar/status/1504254198111776769) (aside from [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) itself). [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is great for downloading videos from the web.

Prefer [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) for video calls.
