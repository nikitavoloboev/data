# Ideas

I share all ideas of things I want to build in [Notion](../sharing/my-notion.md) as well as sharing [all the projects I am making or have made](https://nikiv.dev/projects).

Currently I am focusing my time on building [Learn Anything](learn-anything.md).

I try to give my full attention to any ideas I am working on.

## Notes

- [Good ideas don’t have owners. They belong to everyone.](https://galaxyproject.org/jxtx/)
- [Find a problem. Tell a story. Sell a service. Deliver a result. Build a product.](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1316747172306616321)
- [If your idea already exists it's validation that there's a market for it. If your execution of the same idea is 1) better, or 2) cheaper, you can reach customers in that market.](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1321428353811943424)
- [Make the first draft deliberately bad. It’s hard to write something good from nothing. But it’s easy to look at something and say “I can at least do better than this idiot.” Be the idiot. Then be better. Then be better again...](https://twitter.com/cahollenbeck/status/1327296301596352512)
- [Create what you want to exist.](https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1346171808295350272)
- [There's no upside in hating on someone's idea. You come off as non-believer or ruin their confidence. Instead, just ask the questions that make you hesitate & let them come to their own conclusion. If you're right, you helped them think it through. If you're wrong, you'll learn.](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1019643883376873472)
- [Personal website is the perfect side project / try out new ideas / learn new things playground.](https://twitter.com/Gavmn/status/1399089921814634501)
- [If I have an apple and you have an apple and we exchange them, we both still have one apple. However, if I have an idea and you also have an idea and we exchange them, we both have two ideas.](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1411882234970132481)
- [Audience (who needs help?) > Problem (what do they need help with?) > Product (this solves a problem for my audience) > Success](https://twitter.com/PocketBryan/status/1438615537987293191)
- [Only 4 out of 70+ projects I ever did made money and grew. > 95% of everything I ever did failed. My hit rate is only about ~5%. So...ship more.](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1457315274466594817)
- [It is incredible how utterly useless software is for organizing your personal life better. Personal relationships/calendars, house logistics, entertainment, travel, life goals, shopping, archives, photos/videos, goals, health (!), to-dos - we are still in the Stone Age.](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1504551473945972740)
- [More people should make "1% products". Tiny little gems that have 1% of the functionality, but are obsessively polished and perfect.](https://twitter.com/palm_beach_m/status/1507220620328808449)
- [My best advice for people trying to figure out what’s next is figure out what they want to do after the next thing—the next next thing—and do the thing next that will increase the success of that next next thing (which may just be skipping straight to the next next thing).](https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1519900289855152129)
