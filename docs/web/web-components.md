title: Web Components

# [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction)

[Lit](https://lit.dev/), [Catalyst](https://github.github.io/catalyst/) (used by GitHub) & [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) are interesting. [Shadow](https://github.com/Zaubrik/shadow) seems like a nice template for making new web components.

[Web Components the Right Way](https://github.com/mateusortiz/webcomponents-the-right-way) is a nice guide.

## Notes

- [Interoperability is best delivered via web components. Platform features are more resilient too. Web components will outlast any framework.](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1468961751748136972)
- [One of the most powerful things people tend to write off about Web Components is that they properly package styles with their logic. That, as well as providing a strict CSS API.](https://twitter.com/techytacos/status/1520140205453324288)
