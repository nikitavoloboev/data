# [Web performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance)

Use [web.dev](https://web.dev/measure/) & [WebPage](https://webpagetest.org/) tests to see web page performance. I love using [Solid](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) for building both web apps and static sites. I try and use [lean and efficient frameworks/APIs](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1517163057780195331) whenever I can.

[Local databases that persist not just data but UI is neat concept](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1526225850739347458). [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) seems nice too. [This series](https://twitter.com/tigt_/status/1503755985667698696) is a nice read.

[Qwik](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/qwik.md) has nice ideas around resumability.

## Notes

- Don't ever underestimate the cost performance of cache misses.
- [Bundle size is not your main performance problem (most likely). As long as the cache headers are ok and hosted in a CDN, you are good. Worry about expensive renders or unnecessary network calls before fine-tuning bundle size.](https://twitter.com/scinos/status/1419535719811399683)
- [Page speed factors and how to increase it: 1. User's Network: deploy to edge, move code to server for smaller bundles. 2. Server Network and Code: fast regional DBs, caching. 3. Asset Waterfall: Load in parallel, don't chain. 4. Parse/eval: move code to server for smaller bundles.](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1479111475683737610)
- [Cache dashboard data in Redis on server instead of react-query in the browser. Revalidate it after requests (on an interval so you don't overwork it with high traffic). Expire + push into the cache after writes. Backend investment will yield far greater perf than client.](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1499160939589173248)
- [Often times a “slow” website is literally because it is loading megabytes of 3rd party crap when the app logic itself can be <200kb using any framework. That 5kb you save by not having to use a state management lib is insignificant compared to these. The difference made by choice of framework is insignificant if the payload is dominated by 3rd party bloat.](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1509422910020075521)
- [Have database and app hosted off the same region as each other.](https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1517573869858525184)
- [Few things will teach you more about web development than running your web app through WebPageTest, and working to fix everything that sucks.](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1519690020449177600)
- [WebPageTest can compare waterfalls from two tests](https://twitter.com/stoyanstefanov/status/1547651354050437121)
