# [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

[React Tauri](https://github.com/mdtanrikulu/react-tauri) seems like an interesting alternative for building cross platform apps.

I prefer to build things natively with [SwiftUI](../programming-languages/swift/swift-libraries/swiftui.md) but when I do use Electron, I use [Vite-SolidJS-Electron](https://github.com/ch99q/vite-solid-electron) template to get things started.

## OSS apps

- [Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) - Budgeting app. Local first architecture.
- [Twizzle](https://github.com/kitze/twizzle) - Desktop app for Twitter DM & composing tweets from the menubar.

## Notes

- [Simplest way to add auto-updating to Electron app is to create an empty public GitHub repo, and use update-electron-app. Publish new builds with GitHub releases.](https://twitter.com/maccaw/status/1469182489180708865)
