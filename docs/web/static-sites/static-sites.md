# Static sites

I use [SolidJS](../../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) for all my websites published on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

[tinypages](https://github.com/Borrus-sudo/tinypages), [Eleventy](eleventy.md), [Hugo](hugo.md), [Capri](https://capri.build/) & [Lume](https://github.com/lumeland/lume) look like nice static site generators.

I liked [this article](https://sabrinajewson.org/blog/building-this-site) on building a minimal static site generator in Rust.

## Notes

- [If you've got a static site with a scrollable sidebar, it really helps to memorize the scroll position across page loads.](https://twitter.com/hakimel/status/1262337065670316033)
