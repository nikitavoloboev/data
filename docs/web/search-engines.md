# Search engines

[Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch) is neat together with their [tokenizer lib](https://github.com/meilisearch/charabia) they use. More practically [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) is great for plug and use solution. [Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy), [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io/) & [Edgesearch](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/edgesearch) are interesting too.
