# [Stylish](https://userstyles.org) themes

I once used [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app) Safari Extension to change the looks of sites to have darker colors. The extension lets you import any of [Stylish themes](https://userstyles.org). Here is a [download of all the Cascadea styles I used](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dcnhujryt0ydft5/Cascadea%20Styles.sdb?dl=1). For sites I didn't modify with Cascadea, I ran [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) extension which automatically turns all websites dark although with some performance overhead.

I don't use either of those extensions now (due to performance issues + I prefer light themes often for readability during the day). I dream of the future where all sites switch automatically between light & dark themes based of OS theme setting.

Below are some Stylish themes I used:

I prefer reading wiki with [Dictionary app](https://wokabulary.com/blog/the-built-in-dictionary-on-mac-and-iphone.html) as it's fast to search it.
