# [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Tao of Node](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/) is useful. [Broken Promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV-u_Ow47s0) is a great talk on JS promises.

I use [Bun](../../programming-languages/javascript/bun.md) now instead of node.

[H3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) is nice HTTP lib. If you're not using Bun, [tsno](https://github.com/egoist/tsno) & [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx) are good for running node.

## Notes

- [I use package.json scripts as entrypoints to custom JS scripts. Make is a build tool, not a meta-shellscript format.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26978206)
- [`yarn upgrade-interactive --latest` to bulk choose which packages to upgrade to latest version.](https://twitter.com/debs_obrien/status/1399256756216381441)
