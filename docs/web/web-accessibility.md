# Web accessibility

## Notes

- [UI component libraries are using the term “accessible” too freely. Adding focus styles and copy-pasting some ARIA roles doesn't make your library accessible, neither does adding an “accessibility” page where you claim to conform to WCAG just because you ran a Lighthouse test.](https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1462884917671604228)
- [My big a11y tip is to learn about ARIA roles and accessible names and use a test framework that lets you select by role+name. see your app the way screen reader users do. I find a ton of a11y bugs this way](https://twitter.com/davidcrespo/status/1527321522364219402)
