# Philanthropy

Causes I care most about are [MAPS](https://www.maps.org/donate), [SENS](http://www.sens.org/donate), [Ocean Cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com/) & [Foregen](https://www.foregen.org/). [Effective altruism](../philosophy/effective-altruism.md) is close to my heart.

I also support [Archive.org](https://archive.org/donate/) & [Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org). As well as developers & artists I admire via Patreon/GitHub/...
