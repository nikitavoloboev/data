# Backups

Currently I use [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com) to make scheduled (every 120 hours & after 21:00) encrypted cloud backups of macOS to [BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com/). iOS as well as `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop` on macOS are automatically backed up to iCloud. Other documents are backed up with [Dropbox](../tools/dropbox.md).

I love the fact that I can set up any new mac or phone to use my `exact` and perfect setup without any cruft in seconds. All my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) are online and can be setup on any new mac via few commands, thanks to [Nix](../package-managers/nix/nix.md).

For programming, [Walrus](https://github.com/Clivern/Walrus) seems nice.
