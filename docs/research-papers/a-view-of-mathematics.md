# [A view of mathematics](http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/maths.pdf)

- The fundamental point in that respect is that while so many mathematicians have been spending their entire scientific life exploring that world they all agree on its contours and on its connectivity: whatever the origin of one’s itinerary, one day or another if one walks long enough, one is bound to reach a well known town i.e. for instance to meet elliptic functions, modular forms, zeta functions. “All roads lead to Rome” and the mathematical world is “connected”.
  - In other words there is just “one” mathematical world, whose exploration is the task of all mathematicians and they are all in the same boat somehow.
