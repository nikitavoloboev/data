# Research papers

I keep a [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Papers-Courses-8f00c7c500d5460490a5800c5d5db431) of research papers I am reading and want to read.

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is neat. [Papers We Love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) is a great community.

Below is a list of research papers I read with a link to my own notes of the paper.

## 2017
