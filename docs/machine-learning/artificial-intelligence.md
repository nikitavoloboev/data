# Artificial intelligence

I liked [Joscha Bach's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApHnqHfFWBk) on evolution of AI and how it relates to understanding of [consciousness](../consciousness/consciousness.md).

[Language models](../nlp/nlp.md) like [GPT](chatgpt.md), [DALL·E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) are fascinating. Curious how far scaling [transformer based language models](https://github.com/abacaj/transformers) get, [maybe they get us to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712).

I want to be able to have a voice assistant that 'knows me' and I can asks question too that is actually good. [LA](../ideas/learn-anything.md) is a tool I am building that hopefully eventually solves this problem as it will know in a lot of detail which knowledge you have and your preferences in learning.

[On the Measure of Intelligence](https://twitter.com/alexkowsik/status/1518602848421961730) is a good read. [Bleeding Edge AI](https://bleedingedge.ai/) is nice way to stay up to date on AI.

[Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy) does amazing work in ML. His [interview with Lex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0) and his [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero course](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero) were insightful. Transformer ML models as described in [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) are very useful.

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) & [ChatGPT](chatgpt.md) are my favorite uses of AI right now.

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) has amazing community focused on sharing [ml models](ml-models.md) with community.

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) & [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) do interesting research.

## Notes

- [We will all soon stop emphasizing something was created using AI and we will just focus on creating.](https://twitter.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1599158969771393024)
- [Best part of I, Robot is how it consistently presents robots doing undesirable things not as AI “gone evil” or “run amok” but implications of their programming that humans did not anticipate, which must be understood and fixed like any other engineering problem.](https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1464269135169339393)
- [It’s not neurons, CPUs or Chinese Room inhabitants who understand, it’s the causal structure implemented by them.](https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1536249438154330115)
- [LLMs won’t replace junior coders by doing 100% of their jobs, it’ll replace them by making top-1% coders 50x more productive. You’re not “safe” because you can do things no LLM can. Your competition isn’t the machine gun of bullshit, it’s the person holding it.](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1599464340679114753)
- [Real opportunity in AI for most people will not be in AI but in building a front end around it.](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1601618182875533314)
