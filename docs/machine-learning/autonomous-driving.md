# Autonomous driving

[OpenPilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) looks interesting, would love to try it out on a real car some day.

## Notes

- [Tesla's autopilot program shuts off less than a second before impact so the company can deny it was the cause of the impact.](https://twitter.com/muttgomery/status/1535353454905917446)
