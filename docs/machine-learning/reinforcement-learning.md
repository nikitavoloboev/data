# [Reinforcement learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)

[Acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme), [TorchRL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/rl) & [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) seem nice. [Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning Class](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class) is great intro.

[Reinforcement Learning with Neural Radiance Fields](https://dannydriess.github.io/nerf-rl/) is fascinating.
