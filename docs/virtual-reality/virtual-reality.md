# Virtual reality

I enjoy playing [In Death: Unchained](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2334376869949242/) & [Pistol Whip](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2104963472963790/) on [Oculus Quest 2](https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/). Playing [Walkabout Mini Golf](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2462678267173943/) with friends is a great remote social bonding experience.

## Games

- [Lambda1VR](https://github.com/DrBeef/Lambda1VR) - Port of the Xash3D-FWGS Half Life Engine to Oculus Quest.
