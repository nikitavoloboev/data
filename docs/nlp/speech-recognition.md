[ocotillo](https://github.com/neonbjb/ocotillo) is nice.

## Notes

- [Voice assistants don't seem to stick for most people is that they're actually command line interfaces, but even less discoverable because they don't provide any visible feedback at all.](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1474418620625084420)
