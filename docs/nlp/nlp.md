# Natural language processing

[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) & [Fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) are interesting libraries. [Natural Language Processing with Transformers Book](https://transformersbook.com/) is nice book. [Hugging Face NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) is probably the best NLP intro out there.

[DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) is fascinating. Trying to understand [DALL-E in PyTorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch) implementation.

[Getting started with NLP for absolute beginners](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/getting-started-with-nlp-for-absolute-beginners/) is a nice intro.
