# Universe

[Short History of Nearly Everything Book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/21) is great.

## Notes

- [Cosmological red-shift (caused by the expansion of the universe) does not conserve energy. Expanding universe is not time translation invariant, so energy is not strictly conserved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYM6HMLgIKA)
- [A human is 25 orders of magnitude smaller than the whole universe, but 35 orders of magnitude bigger than a Planck length. We're bigger than average.](https://www.reddit.com/r/quantum/comments/n27xx8/question_in_the_scheme_of_the_size_of_the_known/)
- [Universe & Neurons projections look very similar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/rcpgze/i_had_a_crazy_realisation_on_lsd/)
- [In the beginning the Universe was created. This had made many people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1-the-story-so-far-in-the-beginning-the-universe-was)
