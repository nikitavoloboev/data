# Programming languages

There is a [great article](https://briansteffens.github.io/2017/02/20/from-math-to-machine.html) that goes over how one program can be written in different languages from the most abstract level of Math to Haskell to C to Assembly to actual machine code.

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is an [amazing book](https://chidiwilliams.com/post/crafting-interpreters-a-review/). [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is a nice tool for language practice. I think [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) is currently the best way to learn your first programming language. The interactiveness of it's teaching is incredible. I used it to teach my smaller brother & sister coding by helping them as they did all the exercises. We then went on to use the knowledge of JS/TS to build games & Minecraft mods together on [Replit](https://replit.com/).

I dislike languages with semicolons a lot which is why I prefer [Swift](swift/swift.md) (native GUI) / [Go](go/go.md) (servers/CLI) / [TS](typescript/typescript.md) (browsers/scripting) over any other language right now. [Rust](rust/rust.md) is too slow to compile and also too noisy with syntax. I find Go/Swift plenty fast when I need speed although wish Go was less boilerplaity. If I do want to do some embedded code, I'd probably use [Zig](zig/zig.md) as it's much simpler than Rust and has no GC too. Although even there, [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) is enough I think. [Julia](julia/julia.md) looks nice for any kind of heavy data processing code / ML.

[OCaml](ocaml/ocaml.md) seems interesting as a language to do some [type theory](../math/type-theory/type-theory.md) research in. Has fast compile types and smart inferency type system. Same for [Agda](agda.md)/[Coq](coq/coq.md)/[Idris](idris/idris.md). [Unison](unison.md) has some novel ideas to learn from too.

## Notes

- [I have a very concrete approach for creating categorical models/semantics for PLs. I express the syntax as a GADT, wrap it with a free(r) monad, then work with the resulting kleisli category.](https://twitter.com/tangled_zans/status/1441434927149420547)
- [In general, our software benefits when we use as few languages as possible, because programming languages have such powerful network effects. Embedded DSLs are usually strongly preferable to freestanding ones because we get to reuse so much knowledge and infrastructure.](https://twitter.com/lexi_lambda/status/1533445067381387268)
