# C++

Never wrote C++, [Rust](../rust/rust.md) is much [better for new code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31232722). [Qb](https://github.com/codecat/qb) does seem interesting though for simplifying the build system for C++ at least.

## Notes

- [C++ is a fucking nightmare. There's 5 ways to do everything, ie because of historical reasons. Endless rules about shit like coercions, etc etc.](https://twitter.com/AdamRackis/status/1441233740248719361)
- [The popularity of C++ was definitely helped by the 'being wrong on the internet' effect. Every beginner programmer immediately thought they could do a better stdlib/macrothing/buildsystem because everything was wrong but you had the illusion YOU could do it right.](https://twitter.com/rikarends/status/1441675508757024768)
