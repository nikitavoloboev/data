# [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)

[Companion for SwiftUI](https://twitter.com/JordanMorgan10/status/1500090857210486784) is useful. [Swift with Majid](https://swiftwithmajid.com/) & [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/) are great blogs. [SwiftUI Weekly](http://weekly.swiftwithmajid.com/) is nice newsletter.

[Atomic Architecture](https://github.com/ra1028/swiftui-atomic-architecture) lib is neat. [SwiftUI Sample Apps](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps), [Swiftcord](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/Swiftcord), [CodeEdit](https://github.com/CodeEditApp/CodeEdit) & [Food Truck](https://github.com/apple/sample-food-truck) are nice SwiftUI apps to study. [Jordan's apps](https://github.com/jordansinger?tab=repositories&q=SwiftUI) are nice to study too as they are quite small.

## Notes

- [Setting a random background color is a great way to detect an accidental SwiftUI loop.](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1379483193708052480)
- [SwiftUI is basically just a wrapper around UIKit. You can use UIHostingController to show SwiftUI views inside UIKit hierarchy, and UIViewRepresentable to wrap UIView in a SwiftUI View.](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/r4houz/can_you_combine_swiftui_and_uikit_together/)
- [HStack, VStack, ZStack, and Grid (among many others) conform to Layout, which means you can dynamically switch between them at runtime without re-creating the children, preserving animations](https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1533907604707061760)
