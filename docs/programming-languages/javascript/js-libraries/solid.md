> Simple and performant reactivity for building user interfaces

Using Solid for all my web apps and static sites. Love how it takes all the best parts of [React](../js-libraries/react/react.md) (component tree model with one way data flow & JSX) but does it better due to [fine grained reactivity ](https://dev.to/ryansolid/a-hands-on-introduction-to-fine-grained-reactivity-3ndf) & avoiding VDOM thus being [much faster than React](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1528479450828087299).

[Ryan Carniato](https://twitter.com/RyanCarniato) does [great YouTube videos on web/solidJS](https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanCarniato9/videos) ([SolidJS: Past, Present, Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOgnQ9SuKYk) is insightful, especially part about [future focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOgnQ9SuKYk&t=7555s)). [Solid Start](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start) is great starter template. [solid-primitives/fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solid-primitives/fetch) is great alternative to [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

[Hope UI](https://hope-ui.com/) is nice component library. [Motion One for Solid](https://motion.dev/solid/quick-start) is great for animations.

My [personal site](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikitavoloboev) & [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/tree/main/web) are OSS & built with Solid.

## OSS apps

- [Solid Hacker News](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-hackernews)
- [Solid Storefront](https://github.com/zaiste/solid-storefront) - Open-source e-commerce storefront in Solid.js with TypeScript, GraphQL, URQL & Tailwind CSS.

## Notes

- [To me the biggest difference between React and Solid is that things that can change are wrapped in signals in Solid, and in dependencies arrays in React.](https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1528537000504184834)
- [Components are rendered only once and are there pretty much to organize the code. The built-in components (Show, For) are awesome and should be used instead of following React-type patterns (multiple dynamic returns, map(), etc).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilf34WjMBkU)
