# [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

Like [Jotai](https://jotai.org/)/[Valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio) for more complex state handling. [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is great for web requests & caching. [ahooks](https://ahooks.js.org/) has many useful hooks too. [Tilg](https://github.com/shuding/tilg) is nice for debugging components.

I now am using [Solid](../../js-libraries/solid.md) for all my web apps and static sites, so trying to port many useful hooks from here for Solid.

## Notes

- [You can pass _anything_ into context, including "subscribable" objects (like RxJS observables, etc.). This means that you can share & subscribe to streams of values that change frequently, without causing unnecessary rerenders.](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1228700861024604160)
- [Use useState to force a render](https://twitter.com/spikebrehm/status/1386777164780036099)
- [Every time I think I have a use case for useReducer I end up using useState with an object literal instead.](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1387885971589386240)
- [React Suspense, Hooks, Server Components, TypeScript typed tuples & pattern matching proposal are nice.](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1459543265775128579)
- [Don't use useEffect for fire-and-forget effects. Use it for synchronization. Execute effects in event handlers.](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1521922758581448705)
- [If you hate useEffect, it's probably because you should be using React Query](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/status/1528518570845646848)
- [If you have an effect that needs to be executed when your app starts, it's definitely okay to execute it _outside_ the component, and _not_ in useEffect](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1533798980596940800)
