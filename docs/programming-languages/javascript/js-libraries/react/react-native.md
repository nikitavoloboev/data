# [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

[Solito](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito) & [Expo](expo.md) are neat. [React Native Quick SQLite](https://github.com/ospfranco/react-native-quick-sqlite) is slick too. [Stacks](https://mobily.github.io/stacks/) is useful for layouts. [React Native Url Router](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/react-native-url-router) is neat router. [React Native Developer Tools](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/) is useful.

[Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite), [zART-Stack](https://github.com/KATT/zart) & [React Native template with goodies](https://github.com/gabrielmoncea/react-native-template) seem like nice starters.
