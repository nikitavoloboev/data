# React components

[Ladle](https://github.com/tajo/ladle) is nice tool to develop/share react components. [How to use Props in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component/) is a good guide.

I now am using [Solid](../../js-libraries/solid.md) for all my web apps and static sites, so trying to port many useful hooks from here for Solid.

## Notes

- [Design System opinion: Don't make your <Link\> and <Button\> components support both link and button visuals. Do make your <Link\> and <Button\> components renders either <a\> or <button\> based on the props passed to it ("to" should render an anchor, "onClick" should render a button)](https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1389294014222934018)
