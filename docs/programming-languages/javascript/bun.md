# [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

[Elysia](https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia) is nice web framework.

Prefer using Bun for running all my [TS](../typescript/typescript.md) code. 

[Deno](../../web/deno.md) has interesting ideas too.

I never use [Node](../../web/nodejs/nodejs.md) now as Bun is simply faster and has nicer dev on ramp if I want to contribute.
