# [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)

[Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) & [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) are great. [Rust for JS Devs](https://rustforjs.dev) & [Zero To Prod](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html) ([good notes](https://bitemyapp.com/blog/notes-on-zero2prod-rust/)) are nice too. You can also use [this brief starter guide](https://github.com/jondot/rust-how-do-i-start).

## Templates

- [Rust Service Template](https://github.com/sambacha/rust-service-template)

## Notes

- [Note that `cargo check` is faster than doing a full compile. Also I use the `rust-analyzer` language server for IDE integration to catch errors as I write them. Between the two, my workflow usually avoids the need for actually compiling a binary until I'm ready to run tests.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21759255)
- [Every reference in Rust has a lifetime, but the compiler is usually smart enough to infer it.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24294960)
- [Rust's key feature - the borrow-checker - relies on the idea that each value has a single "owner" at any given time. This owner can be a function, another value (a parent struct), etc. You can put these values on the heap, but if you use Box (the go-to for heap allocation), that pointer still has to have a single logical "owner". Under idiomatic Rust, each value effectively lives in one single "place". This allows the compiler to determine with 100% confidence at what point it's no longer being used and can therefore be de-allocated.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24991848)
  - Now, these values can be lent out ("borrowing") to sub-functions and such via references (mutable or immutable). Multiple immutable references can be handed out at once, but a mutable reference to a value has to be the only reference to that value of any kind, at a given time.
- [My go to for Rust actors package is usually tokio::sync::mpsc and tokio::spawn.](https://twitter.com/DavidPdrsn/status/1418554353586262021)
- [For error handling: We use anyhow for applications, thiserror for libraries.](https://lobste.rs/s/xbncik/rust_first_thoughts)
- [Once you internalize Rust's concept of ownership and its criticality to memory safety, it forever changes how you look at C/C++ code. You will constantly be amazed - and demoralized - by how often C/C++ code doesn't document memory lifetimes/ownership in its API contracts.](https://twitter.com/indygreg/status/1425314471950491650)
- [Rust enums are amazing. They are also known as Sum Types.](https://twitter.com/clementd/status/1434583356969308160)
- [If you're building a database , OS, or other systems-level infrastructure, choose Rust. If you're not building those things, choose not-Rust. Rust is the better C we've all been hoping for. But most companies have no business writing programs in C, or even in a better C.](https://twitter.com/jdegoes/status/1459899722358009860)
- [If you are starting learning Rust, try to follow this rule of thumb: only owned types in fields of your own types, always return owned values unless you're passing through directly from a function argument, clone liberally, derive(Copy) when possible, use Arc/RefCell to unblock.](https://twitter.com/ekuber/status/1476128384908410882)
