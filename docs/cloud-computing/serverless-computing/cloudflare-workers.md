# [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)

Can build and release websites fully on [Cloudflare stack](https://twitter.com/pbteja1998/status/1496147994533679105). [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2) & [Miniflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare) are useful ([nice template for it](https://github.com/mrbbot/miniflare-typescript-esbuild-jest)).

[Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) ([nice starter template](https://github.com/honojs/compute-starter-kit)), [Worktop](https://github.com/lukeed/worktop) & [workers Go lib](https://github.com/syumai/workers) seem like nice web frameworks built on top of Cloudflare workers.

Exploring building fast web apps with [Solid](../../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md), [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) and [D1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31339299) (replicated [SQLite](../../databases/sqlite.md)) as data store with lots of smart caching.

## Notes

- [Think of Durable Objects as in memory cache in JavaScript spread across all edges globally with two specialties: 1. It’s automatically scaled and persisted to durable storage after workers finish execution. 2. It’s single threaded globally so you effectively get a write lock on them. The object actually only runs in one single location. And then based on the requests coming to it, Cloudflare moves it around to the most optimum location.](https://twitter.com/chatsidhartha/status/1460511611756728323)
