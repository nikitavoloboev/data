# [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

[Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) seems nice. [Netlify Edge Functions seem cheaper/better](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1516508728274690054).

## Notes

- [I just reduced latency by \~ 10x by bumping memory from default to \~1GB. w/ provisioned concurrency brought the request time down to around 30ms w DDB](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1299846109448282112)
