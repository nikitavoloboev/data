# [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

AWS has a [nice free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), [Digger](https://digger.dev/) & [ts2asl](https://github.com/Stedi/ts2asl) are nice. [SLIC Starter](https://github.com/fourTheorem/slic-starter) seems great as AWS serverless starter.

Haven't used AWS but did use [GCP](../gcp/gcp.md) which is similar and had horrendous experience. From now on, I avoid AWS/GCP fully because not only is their UI horrendous, it's pricing is insane too.

## Notes

- [If you have an S3 bucket with zero files in it, it doesn’t incur storage charges. You can put a lifecycle rule on an S3 bucket that will automatically expire files after say 30 days.](https://lobste.rs/s/w36hds/packing_encrypting_uploading)
- [Can store everything in SSM & not use environment variables.](https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1455944479626743809)
