# 2021 March

Watched [Better Call Saul](https://trakt.tv/shows/better-call-saul). An amazing show truly.

Took a break from work this month despite the hard set goals I set for myself. Breaks are good too if you can afford them.

What's happening to [Navalny](https://twitter.com/navalny) always puts my life in perspective. Why can humans be so bad, it's insane to me. I hope he will be freed soon and Russia actually starts to prosper.

The other little things I appreciated this month were spending a lot of time with my GF. Walking, drinking coffee and talking about all the different things. The weather is finally starting to be warm again which is great.

I did learn quite a bit this month and started going through the [CSS for JS devs course](https://css-for-js.dev/).

This month has been quite funny too especially with the [boat getting stuck](https://stone-soup.ghost.io/archive/i-like-that-the-boat-is-stuck/).

Oh and [Fuck This Pandemic](https://eng.rekki.com/fuck-this-pandemic/pandemic.txt).

[This](https://open.spotify.com/track/2lF5acSU8Vu9292cthQmc5?si=DhLiuvcBQ_-blgLtlrnf0Q) is my new goto focus song. üå∏

And tripping [listening to Hania Rani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFRdoYfZYUY) is bliss. [13:00 onwards](https://youtu.be/kFRdoYfZYUY?t=820) is ‚ô•Ô∏è. [Leaving](https://open.spotify.com/track/5kGMJTXKSDrFRGAgeLmavm?si=H9Aa-Iv-RaKWDEylBx1kJQ) is the song.
