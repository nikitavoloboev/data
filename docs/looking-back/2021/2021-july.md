# 2021 July

My GF came back from her trip to Russia which was nice. Continuing work on LA. Was invited by [Kirill](https://twitter.com/kirjs) on his podcast where [I talked (in Russian) about learning in public as well as translating an article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqWX6hZdAoU). Was fun and it was my first time ever being part of some podcast, let alone talking in Russian publicly too (I mostly use English now).
