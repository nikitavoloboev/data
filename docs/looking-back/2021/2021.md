# 2021

One thing I truly learned and internalized this year:

> Who I am is not what I think of myself in my head. It's the actions and things I say and do! Showing love & affection is very important (to family/partner & friends too).

It's great to realize it fully now that I am 26. People judge & think of you by your actions and not your intentions.

I don't have much to say about this year except it was quite tough mentally/financially. I didn't really progress much on my projects except this wiki. Switched jobs from CodeYellow to Droppa. Became more confident with front end and code in general. I'm now in a nice place where I am confident I can build anything given some time.

Going to use Notion a lot going into this year, especially this [`Goals` board](https://www.notion.so/e462537d8f3d40c095ea67091ca91f45?v=1006717e984a4243b198bcad5bf05198). Will contain high level goals I want to work on as well as themes (things/areas-to-focus to keep in mind). Includes the [6 habits I need to do](../../focusing/habits.md)!

I also need to build a tool to block out distractions fully during my `focus blocks`. I previously used [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) for it but want to build something more custom/streamlined for myself. Ability to start pomodoro timers via hotkeys/Alfred + websites blocked during my focus time (HN/Twitter/Lobsters/Reddit/GitHub (front page)) for me. I wasted too much time on pointless things in 2021. No regrets of course but this won't happen in 2022! Only good vibes and useful projects.
