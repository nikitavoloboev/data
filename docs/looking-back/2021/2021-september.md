## Did

Joined [Droppa](https://www.droppa.com) and am super excited. âœ¨

Both the team and the product is pleasure to work with and it's nice to work on something still so early on in its development.

## Learned

The only thing that still gives me pain to work with is CSS. Going to learn it better this and next month. If I can layout things on the screen with ease, everything else (getting things from some DB, setting an API and fetching data) is rather easy. In my opinion. Animation too seems tough.
