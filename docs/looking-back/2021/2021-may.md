Learned next.js more. Came back to NL. Worked on [Reflect](https://reflect.app/) for a bit.

Been loving listening to [Один в каное](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VznuGjUSbOY). Want to see them live. ♥️

Learned some [valuable relationship lessons](../../focusing/rules.md#relationships) these past few months. Like that I need to express my love to my partner more and never say or do any hurtful things, ever. Applies to all relationships but especially when it relates to a romantic relationship of a person you love.

Trust is the most important thing you can earn in a relationship and it's very easy to lose it.
