Never give up. Don't waste time. Build. This corona virus & its effects on the world is something. Happy that we give Earth a break. I can't wait to get in position where I can actually drive change in this world. And for that you need to build tools and drastically optimize and change archaic processes that exist now.

The whole situation in US is just sad. The amount of stealing and abuse that takes place daily. Human lives are worth nothing. It's all about [preserving and building new capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fqn42e/unacceptable_dems_fume_after_trump_announces_plan/). Capitalism is fun.

I'm focusing 100% of my time on LA now.
