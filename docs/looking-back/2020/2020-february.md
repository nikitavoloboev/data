# 2020 February

Spent a lot of time writing React, RN & Go. Super fun. Never been more happy with life in like ever.

Past year has been the biggest hustle of my life. Dropping out of uni. Switching 3 jobs. Now to end up on a fourth. The best one of all. Incredible amount of growth condensed into that time period. I took the chances I had and worked hard. The best is yet to come.

I started to note down [goals](../../focusing/goals.md) as a way to anchor my focus. Will see where that leads. Just need to act on my plans. That's all.
