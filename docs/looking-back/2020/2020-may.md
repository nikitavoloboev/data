Want to do good. It hurts to see that [not everyone is treated with respect and kindness](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gvc7k9/black_lives_matter/). [No one is born racist](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/gv4vzz/racism_destroyed_in_one_minute/). And everything can be unlearned and we all can do better.

Wasn't a productive month for me. I want to do so much but need to take steps into building things rather than consuming & 'learning' & growing my wiki. The wiki is at this moment 24,344 lines of content which is insane. I seriously need to invest time in building LA as a dream store of knowledge. I did start building out my new site with [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) though and that's going well. Will have a blog and nice pretty static site I will extend and make into my own digital garden. ðŸŒ±

I also need to prep some algorithms & data structures (in Go) as I want to pass any interview an employer might throw at me, algorithmic or system design. Work, work, work. ðŸŒŠ
