# 2020 December

Built more things with Django/React at [Codeyellow](https://www.codeyellow.nl/). Also got to try Flutter/Dart for first time.

Expanded the wiki more and actually got to finally make out a more step by step plan of the courses/projects I want to complete & in what order.

Watched [Start-Up](https://trakt.tv/shows/start-up-2020) & started rewatching [Breaking Bad](https://trakt.tv/shows/breaking-bad).
