# 2020 November

Updated macOS and bricked my computer. Had to give it to repair so they restored data from it & reinstalled the OS. If you are reading this, [make recurring backups](../../backups/backups.md). ðŸ˜±

Aside from that incident, been a busy month. Lots of code & learning.

Watched & loved [Fleabag](https://trakt.tv/shows/fleabag).

I find it exciting how in just this month, [protein folding was seemingly close to being solved](https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/). Vaccines for Covid are started to be rolled out. The rocket that will eventually fly to Mars is starting to be tested. As well as company being formed to [start space manufacturing](https://twitter.com/zebulgar/status/1336372528420278274). Its wild.

Need to be [more ambitious with my goals](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1336537384041660417) & work harder/smarter. Meet more people & experience more places/cultures.
