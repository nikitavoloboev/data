Moving to London and joining Gyana has been an amazing opportunity for me. The team is amazing and the product we are working on is incredibly exciting and impactful.

Will make the most of my time in this large city. My last biggest city I've lived in was Amsterdam and I never got time to really see anything. Need to start living more. And building.
