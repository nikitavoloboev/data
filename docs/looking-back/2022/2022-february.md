It's madness that Putin decided to invade Ukraine this month. Have no words honestly, except that [Zelensky is an inspirational leader](https://twitter.com/earlgreytea220/status/1497704616309534720) and Ukrainians are incredibly brave and principled to stand to such aggression. This should finally make Russia a truly free non oppressed country.
