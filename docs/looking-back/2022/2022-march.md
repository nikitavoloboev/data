Got married in Limassol, Cyprus. ðŸ˜»

Spent most of the time in Costa by the beach writing code. I want to create some kind of fund for homeless cats in Cyprus, there is just too many of them. And food/water is not that easy to come by. The smarter ones often chill next to restaurants.

## Listened

Discovered [Ghostly Kisses](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7EkzQPP0cgt2qCnXUg6PHj) this month, [she is great](https://open.spotify.com/track/0YRYs1HSkie0eZ02ON4euX). Got a new goal of listening to [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/2k750ut7R7B2M2oWZtE2jC) while walking in some new city in evening.

## Seen

Started 4th season of Ozark.

## Goals

War is horrible. Hope Ukraine pulls through and grows stronger than ever. It's much harder to focus on things given what's happening right now.

I will be building out more of Droppa together with some personal projects I want to release soon. Also still learning a bit of Rust on the side.
