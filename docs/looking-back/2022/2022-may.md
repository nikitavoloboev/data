Learned bit more of [SolidJS](../../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) & trying out [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) for building out APIs.

Found a [nice coffee place to work from](https://g.page/LUCIFER-BAR-KENNEDYPLEIN) in Eindhoven. I found the most important thing for actually productive work is a good chair and ideally some novel environments.
