# 2022 July

Staying in my parent's Spanish house this Summer. Going to build some exciting things hopefully. Every time I come back and meet the family, I'm reminded by what I truly care about. My dogs: Rachel and Layci. The cats: Lex, Snoop and Didi. My family. My fiance. It's nice to spend time with them. I also hope to teach my sister and brother coding. I had my first few lessons already and it was great fun. 

## 1: Picking up day evaluations & Obsidian

Going to try bring back the habit of writing [day evaluations](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e). Now in [Obsidian](../../tools/obsidian.md). Not sure how to handle ability to combine private entries with public inline ideally. So as I write each summary of the day, I still have private space to write that won't get committed and published.

Today I found out I spent 70€ for an empty database because I genuinely thought it would cost max 5€ to just have an empty DB up with [GCP](../../cloud-computing/gcp/gcp.md). Lessons learned.

I am also exploring more of [entgo](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started/). And we started watching [Haunting of Hill House](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-haunting-of-hill-house). It's actually quite scary at times.

Oh and it's been fun watching Chess 2022 candidates. [Rapport](https://twitter.com/rjrapport), [Nepo](https://twitter.com/lachesisq?lang=en) & [Nakamura](https://twitter.com/GMHikaru) had some fun games.
