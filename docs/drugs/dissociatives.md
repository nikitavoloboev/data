## Notes

- [Dissos make you feel like you are outside of your mind and separated, yet still inside your body. Traveling to other planes is easy on a k hole dose, and sub hole doses make following "thought threads" easier, leading you to new ideas sometimes without realizing you're going there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/82olpw/difference_between_ketamine_and_shrooms_or/)
