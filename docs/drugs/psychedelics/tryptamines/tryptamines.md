## Notes

- [With 5-MeO-DMT for most people the bodyload is so extreme, that medium dosages are just very unpleasant experiences. When you dose higher and get the release, then that's not a problem anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/9yhmv7/first_time_5_meo_dmt/)
- [In a Keta hole, you lose any coupling to your body and physical reality, but you usually keep a sense of self.](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/9yhmv7/first_time_5_meo_dmt/ea3aiof)
  - On 5-MeO-DMT YOU (your ego, what you wrongly think you are) will die!!! And you have to be able to accept this. If not, you will fight for your (your ego's) survival the whole duration and experience a hellish trip.
  - When you can accept to give up and die, then you will usually experience something that is not only beyond words, but beyond what the brain mind can ever understand. You experience the truth of it all, that all is nothing but one infinite consciousness, which is pure timeless existence, love, bliss.
  - And it's no coincidence, that 5-MeO-DMT trip reports are mostly either reports of pure terror, or of pure bliss, depending on their acceptance to die or not...
- Another way to imagine it is that 5-MeO-DMT peels away layers. Most psychedelics adds visual or emotional aspects. Take DMT for example it adds a completely amazing visual aspect and many times an emotional one too. 5-MeO-DMT strips you completely naked. If you "succeed" and break through you become consciousness in its pure form - completely empty, unlocated infinite consciousness that people often refer to as "the void". But the void can sound almost negative as it's lacking something but rather it's just where everything comes from.
- In short: DMT eradicates your physical reality, but you keep yourself, while 5-MeO-DMT eradicates YOU (your ego).
- [One way to compare them would be that nn dmt is an immersive visual experience but there is still a perceiver of events as there is a duality between subject and object, eg seeing entities that are perceived to be separate from the self, 5 meo dmt induces complete ego death where there is no longer even a perciever of events, all boundaries disappear and your awareness becomes infinite. This is why people believe that you become God on a 5 meo breakthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/9ssa0g/dmt_vs_5meo_dmt/)
- [A recent study showed that the neurogenesis caused by Psilocybin occurred even when a 5-HT2Ar antagonist was given alongside it. The trip was prevented but not the neurogenesis. I think all we currently know is that it’s more complicated than simply activation of the 5-HT2Ar leading to neurogenesis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDrugNerds/comments/ogdvnd/why_does_mdma_cause_a_comedown_while_psilocybin/)

  - I think something that is going to be incredibly important as psychedelic research continues is to clearly communicate that cell proliferation, neurogenesis and neuronal survivability are not in-and-of-themselves always positive. While it is certainly novel that these agents cause what appears to be beneficial growth rather than damage, we need to think critically about what exactly these morphological changes are, which neurons are proliferating and why.
  - I could dive into this much more if I had the time but keep in mind that there are diseases that arise from the excessive proliferation of cells as well (cancer) and while I'm not suggesting that psychs cause or contribute to that disease we need to keep in mind that pushing equilibrium in either direction can have pathogenic consequences.
  - That being said, I am a huge fan of these substances and work in drug abuse research. One of my main reasons for pursuing this career was to study these drugs and I hope to be able to soon.
