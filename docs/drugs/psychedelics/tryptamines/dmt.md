# [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=DMT)

I love all [tryptamines](tryptamines.md) but am yet to breakthrough on DMT. [Many say it's life changing](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/u8la4o/why_is_dmt_treated_like_some_kind_of_special/).

## Notes

- [High dose of DMT. It'll be the closest thing to death without actually dying. What you realize is, on the other side of that threshold, a core piece of you will persist. Death is an illusion, consciousness exists forever/outside of time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/7sec24/does_any_psychedelic_allow_you_to_make_peace_with/)
  - I think, to your point, all entheogens will help you (if you're ready for them), but a full fledged high blast of DMT, to quote Terrance McKenna, "is the farthest out one can go and still come back."
- [DMT is a funny drug, the more you take of it, the easier the trip becomes. It's these mid-range doses that are the worst. Reality is partially slipping away, and your ego, doing its job, is trying hard to grab a hold of what's left of it. You end up with a very anxious ego that thinks its about to die and a terrible trip.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/7zqb5i/anyone_else_got_traumatized/)
- DMT refers specifically to dimethyltryptamine, a tryptamine molecule with two methyl groups on the N position. 5-MeO-DMT shares the same methyl groups but has an additional methoxy group on the 5 position creating an entirely different substance. It is not DMT.
- [It’s all in your mind. Notice how you said that as soon as you remember that things can turn bad they do. It’s because you literally just created that experience by focusing on it. That’s how amazing and powerful you truly are. Everything and everyone you meet on dmt is ultimately you, reflecting back to yourself. You can’t really “think of nothing” because that means you’re trying to control the experience. Simply surrender to whatever happens, if you feel scared then just let the feeling be. Observe it. That’s what it means to become a true psychonaut. Once you get passed that stage then you can go deeper into the experiences and pick up more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/89mmsl/scared_of_dmt/)
- [I too had a similar "you are so lucky message." Except mine was more "everything is okay, you're doing fine."and "appreciate this life you live."](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5zimh9/first_dmt_experience_i_wasnt_ready/deyx02z/)
- [We're here because we decided to be. DMT gives you a glimpse of the other side, of the world we come from before birth and go to after death. We choose to put on the mask of ego in order to forget the fact that we already know everything. You now know more than most, having peeled back the skin of reality before it was time to. You'll gradually forget over time. Time heals the ego.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/8ic954/my_mind_wants_to_forget_that_i_did_dmt/)
  - So don't worry, you'll be fine. But take what you've learned and use it to live a good and fulfilling life with the time you have left. Once you pop out the other side, you'll probably decide to come back and be born as something anew. You'll do it to escape the boredom of knowing all. So don't take it so seriously my man. Enjoy yourself, you chose to be here.
- [I’m starting to feel like the vastness of DMT, and the potential that it is truly a gateway to another, real dimension, should leave you feeling a new level of humility and gratitude to simply be alive and able to have these incredible experiences. To be able to peek behind the curtain so to speak, is truly an honor, which is my main takeaway from DMT.... and let’s face it, it’s a hell of a lot of fun too! I don’t think we should discount the fun factor. It doesn’t always have to be so earth-shatteringly serious and heavy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/8j3syx/anyone_else_feels_that_the_dmt_experience_is_so/)
- [I don't think it's a coincidence most "DMT Waiting Room" images involve a toroidal field.](https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/8t9zkf/i_dont_think_its_a_coincidence_most_dmt_waiting/)
- [Even though every DMT trip is different, I feel that every time I do it I come back to the same conclusion. That I am simply an illusion. When I had my breakthrough, thats what it's like when the illusion of self ends. Except when you die for real you don't have a body to come back to. That is what the DMT experience always tells me: That it's all an illusion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/93od26/advice_for_people_who_want_to_try_dmt/)
- [Meditate for a few minutes. Let yourself know you will be ok, because you will. It will not physically harm you. Whatever you get out of it, don’t take it too seriously, but don’t completely ignore it either. Understand that it is only a few minutes and you will come back. Most likely when you do come back, you’ll probably want to go right back in.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/9fmxf6/i_cannot_physically_make_myself_consume_dmt/)
  - Don’t have any expectations. Take your hit, lay back, smile, and submit. Tell it to take you, and you’ll probably have a good experience.
  - Or don’t do it at all. If your anxiety outweighs your curiosity, then don’t do it. Hang onto it and maybe a day comes when you feel ready. It’s not something you have to do.
- Yocan evolve with ceramic donut coils works great. Load dose into the bucket, pulse button to melt. As you hold down the button it will start to vaporize. Take one long slow drag and hold it in.
  - You do not need to worry about breathing, your body will automatically regulate that for you in most cases. Unless you have a medical condition. So just don't even worry about it, just hold it as long as you possibly can cause your body will force you to breathe when it gets too hard.
- For smoking changa with pipe: [Pack the pipe loosely, exhale completely, lightly inhale while gently getting the top completely lit then take the biggest inhale you can and hold as long as you can, repeat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/a0d9tn/how_to_smoke_changa_with_a_pipe/)
- [Once the changa is lit, you should take the lighter away and keep sucking. This will help prevent it from burning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/5oz389/how_to_smoke_change_with_a_pipe/)
- [DMT's existence in people, animals, plants, and so on, really isn't that surprising at all. Lots of molecules exist in biological creatures that serve no necessary purpose, but are there merely because they are the unintentional enzymatic products of other essential compounds in the body. DMT is directly derived from Tryptophan, which exists in pretty much all biological life, and is just a few enzymatic transformations away from DMT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/b3v4fc/why_are_many_dmt_users_fixated_on_the_possibility/)
  - Amazing comment with more info that follows
- [You are a group of billons neurons riding a muscle powered skeleton.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/crhchg/holy_fucking_shit/ex7v7dt/?context=1) Great summary of DMT experience.
- [Hit it til you cant, hit it like it hit you first, hit it like you want to go where it wants to take you, be eager, forget what you know, it will be kind to you that way](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/c5y0zo/breakthroughs_on_changa/)
- It's not about how many hits one takes it's about the dose one takes.
- 4-6 hits for changa. Just keep doing 15 second draws until you can’t.
- [For changa: Smoke it out of a any pipe suitable for weed, a small bong is ideal. Also the trick is to corner it and pull the cherry until it's all lit because if you just torch it it'll burn the dmt and the smoke will be horrible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/cbc2zu/do_you_smoke_changa_the_same_as_pure_dmt/)
  - If you can get it right it's like breathing in air. The idea is by lighting it slowly you vaporise most of the dmt in the changa. However if in the moment it's not working feel free to light the whole thing up though there's no real rush if the changa contains any significant amount of harmalas.
- [The DMT experience is extremely intense compared to baseline 0, normal sober human you. You should definitely understand that before indulging into the experience. The fear of death that has come back to you is natural and that fear can come in waves throughout life as our mindset is constantly changing. It's fine and actually pretty normal because right now you are living as a person.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/avg824/im_going_to_smoke_freebase_dmt_for_my_first_time/)
  - Try to understand again who you are from third person perspective. Know who you are conceptually and understand that the mask you wear at this moment, the person who's life you live out, is made up of all influences (conscious and subconscious) that have culminated since the day of your meat suit's beholder's birth. Understand that you are simply consciousness having a human experience.
  - This being said you (the idea of you) are going to die on DMT. It's almost like an immediate ego/complete reality death after inhaling the DMT smoke. This is okay though, its not supposed to be scary, rather [the idea of you dying] is quite informative because it's almost like you're being given proof that you are consciousness having a human experience. The feeling I can compare it to now is throwing up very quickly and intensely, but you're throwing up information and it's all going back into yourself and you're just taking it all in getting faster and faster until it's so fast that it's still and everything happens all at once like holy shit this is IT. I AM. It's so weird to try and conceptualize but so mesmerizing/restrictive to know what happens and be conscious of not having the words to be able to explain it. It's a wild cycle
  - You are smoking DMT for some kind of reason. If you're going to make the decision to let go and allow the life changing experience to take place, then you should just go balls to the wall and smoke pure DMT, especially if you have pure DMT. Allow whatever happens to happen, that will be a part of the experience. I hope you gain the most you can from your experience my friend.

- [Changa smoking: Great guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/arrimi/advice_about_doing_changa_dmt_for_the_first_time/)
- [Harmaline compound inhibits the activity of the enzyme, monoamino-oxidase (MAO), which breaks down DMT. With other words, if you take a MAO inhibitor like harmaline and then take DMT, you get an extended DMT trip since the DMT is not broken down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/n8hqny/alright_guys_im_throwing_in_the_towel_enough_dmt/)
- [Take an oral MAOI next time you smoke DMT. I use harmine HCL. Perfectly legal to buy in most places, you can even buy it on Amazon. It’s a sparkly yellow powder. I take 250mg of the stuff, then wait an hour, then put like 50mg under my tongue for ten minutes. Then take two or three good pulls off the DMT pipe and it is utterly out of this fucking world. It’s like a night-and-day difference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/rzpix5/why_doesnt_dmt_teach_me_anything/)
- [Couple of sub breakthrough doses of DMT with another psychedelic and it is like an intensity shot for your trip, almost guaranteed to elongate it for an hour or so. Breakthrough doses are almost like being blown up by and bomb and trying to make sense of the shrapnel. It’s too confusing and I don’t really get anything from it other than mindfuck and “what the fuck was that?” It doesn’t really help me in any way other than eye candy and the feeling of being “shot into space.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/u8la4o/why_is_dmt_treated_like_some_kind_of_special/)
- [I think just the fact that you can experience something as profound and reality bending as a DMT trip shows us that there is a lot more to .. well, everything. Whether it’s real or not means nothing to me. It completely dissolves your understanding of what’s real, and then questioning it doesn’t matter anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/w7d49p/do_you_think_dmt_breakthrough_trips_are_real_or/)
- [My realization after DMT is that we're all in an infinite simulation where we are micro-perceptions of the "all". God, experiencing himself in a loving choreographed dance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/wbj02s/i_feel_like_its_all_a_lie/)
