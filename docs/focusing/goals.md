# Goals

Goal plan is in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/e462537d8f3d40c095ea67091ca91f45?v=1006717e984a4243b198bcad5bf05198).

## Action

### Learn Anything

Make the best tool for learning anything and sharing ideas. Release website, mobile app, API. Build up community.

### Expand personal site

Lots of [inspiration](../design/design-inspiration.md). I want a personal space I can expand and build upon (experiment).

Blog, wiki, art, projects, photos. Look backs as nice newsletters + rich derived data (from GitHub/Twitter/..).

### Read books / papers

Read relevant books & papers.

### Build better tools for everything

Lots of ideas around improving my workflow further. Build them.

## Theme

### Healthy mind/body

Eat healthy and exercise daily. Work ergonomically. Follow [rules](rules.md).

### Learn what matters. Solve problems. Share learnings.

Understand tools I use deeply. Solve problems & write about what I learned.

### Remove complexity/waste. Streamline processes.

Remove any friction I feel. Filter out wasteful news, info. No thoughtless actions. Focus on goals & todos. No time wasted.

### Go out of my comfort zone. Meet people.

Make screencasts/videos to educate. Write. Practice photography. Compose music. Design. Share & learn with community.

Be inspired & improve myself. Reach out to people I admire.

### Plan bigger. Save the planet.

Create [amazing things](../ideas/ideas.md) for a [better future](../future/future.md).

Focus on solving real global problems like reversing climate change ([electrically powered everything](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/battery-day/), fully renewable energy), [saving animals](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/iwujp5/humans_wiped_out_twothirds_of_the_worlds_wildlife/) (animal rights same as humans, can't be eaten, can't be harmed) and [overthrowing oppressive regimes](../travel/visited/russia.md).

Earth is for everyone, not just humans. Be kind. Be goal & [value](../business/startups/values.md) driven.
