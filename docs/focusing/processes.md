# Processes

Good processes are essential for any kind of repeated [success](../life/success.md). Below are some personal processes I try follow for myself when doing certain things.

I think of my [rules](rules.md) as boundaries within I try to operate my life. And processes are series of steps I should take when doing certain things. Some are vaguer than others. If I do them enough times, they become part of my [habits](habits.md).

## Morning

1. Wake up at ~ 9:00. 
2. If with dogs, go take dogs outside (listen to [podcasts](../podcasts/podcasts.md) a bit)
3. Shower. Wash body + [skin care](../health/skin-care.md) on face. [Brush teeth](../health/teeth.md). Wear new clothes.
4. If with dogs, give food to dogs + 2 pills for Rachel (put in bowl).
5. Make [tea](../health/nutrition/drinks/tea.md) (big kettle)
6. 4 eggs + salad (tomatoes + avocado + feta + ..). [Optional smoothie](../health/nutrition/supplements.md#smoothie).
7. Take [2 omega 3 pills + 1 magnesium](../health/nutrition/supplements.md)
8. Twitter 2 feeds actively, snapshot github/lobsters/hn/reddit. (should be automated asap, have my own algorithm for surfacing useful to me things, removing noise)
