# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to ensure I complete my 6 daily habits I try to follow to live a [happy life](../life/happiness.md). The habits are chosen with great care and are a subset of my life [rules](rules.md) .

I get a notification every day at 20:00 on my phone to complete the habits.

## Habits described

`Cardio / Weights` autofilled through my health data. It includes workout minutes from running/cycling & bodyweight/lifting workouts. Bodyweight/lifting is tracked with [Strong](https://strong.app), [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com), [Fitbod](https://www.fitbod.me) or [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com) apps.

`Activity rings` autofilled through my health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is ~ 700 calories with fixed 50 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Health | Clean` marked as done when I drank mostly water & tea with limited coffee (if any, as I often get attention crashes after). I also ate only/primarily [nutritious whole foods (nuts/veggies/fruits/..)](../health/nutrition/foods.md) with focus on completing my [micro & macro nutrient goals](../health/nutrition/nutrition.md). I also [kept my skin clean](../health/skin-care.md) and washed/smelled well throughout the day.

`Focus | Impact` marked as done when I was not distracted by anything during the day (went through my todos one by one) (no analytics & pointless time wasters). I worked on my [goals](goals.md) & used time wisely. I was calm, mindful and happy.

`Happy | Open / Kind` marked as done when all/most of my [values](../business/startups/values.md) and [rules](rules.md) were held well. I showed love to people I care about & myself (true love & letting go of any mistake/accident). I made new things and shared them. I was myself & unafraid of anything. Happiness is often a side effect of a nice day.

`Plan | Journal` marked as done when I made a plan for tomorrow and reflected on the day in [my journal](../looking-back/looking-back.md). Writing helps me clear up my mind and clean up life and my thinking. Planning includes: 1. Calendar check. 2. Tasks (for next day, especially important to define the first task!). Everything is planned as per the week goals.

## New habits

I try learn new habits proactively by building systems and thought processes that lead me in [directions](../focusing/goals.md) I want to go. Everything is built around well defined [rules](../focusing/rules.md) & [processes](../focusing/processes.md).

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
- [Tiny friction goes a long way. To create healthy behavior, start with healthy defaults.](https://twitter.com/thelindazhang/status/1363318010266587136)
- [I think we go through life in a mentally linear way but our life is actually a repeating fractal spiral. It is not until we wake up and become a 3D person in a 2D world we are able to see our behavioral patterns. Only then can we step aside or over some of the repeating problems we have been having issues with. Most of my profound psychedelic realizations are involving me "waking up" like this. With enough quality data on yourself, you can begin to identify the loops you speak of. And the crazy thing is that all of your behaviors is connected in wild ways, that is once you start to chart it all out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/sbfr1n/whats_your_most_irrational_belief_doesnt_have_to/)
- [If I want to improve at anything, I have a fixed approach. I call it the 30-for-30 plan: The structure is simple: 30 days. 30 minutes per day.](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1517129074178674688)
