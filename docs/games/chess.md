# Chess

Loved watching [Queen's Gambit](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-queen-s-gambit). I play on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) (desktop) & [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/play/apps) on phone (puzzles / blitz games). [Lichess has cleaner UI](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/uh2409/as_an_experiment_i_told_myself_id_use_nothing_but/).

I enjoy watching [great chess games](https://lichess.org/games) & listening to [game analysis](https://www.youtube.com/user/RosenChess/videos). [Magnus Carlsen](https://www.chess.com/players/magnus-carlsen), [Ian Nepomniachtchi](https://www.chess.com/players/ian-nepomniachtchi), [Mikhail Tal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnx7w_xuguGl3y2Utxhp6eAKi9KhVlcx), [Daniil Dubov](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=daniil+dubov) &
[Teimour Radjabov](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeimourRadjabovChess/videos) games are joy to watch.

[Gotham Chess](https://www.youtube.com/c/GothamChess/videos), [Eric Rosen](https://www.youtube.com/user/RosenChess/videos) and [Daniel Naroditsky](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHP9CdeguNUI-_nBv_UXBhw/videos) have lots of videos to learn Chess from + enjoyable commentary.

## Interesting openings

- [Ruy Lopez](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/r8qdqq/can_someone_explain_why_the_ruy_lopez_is_so/)

## Notes

- [Most "best moves" in a game are quite obvious. Most blunders occur in the endgame because the position is complicated and there's usually only 1 good move and everything else is terrible. So you think a lot trying to find the 1 good move and then fail.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/nwq4qk/blunder_rate_versus_time_spent_on_move_25_million/)
