# Generative art

This [article](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/what-is-generative-art) & [p5.js demos](https://p5-demos.glitch.me/) are great intros. [WEIRD-A](https://github.com/inconvergent/weird), [Processing](../programming-languages/processing/processing.md) & [p5.js](../programming-languages/processing/p5js.md) are great frameworks.
