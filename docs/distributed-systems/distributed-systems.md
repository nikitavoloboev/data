# Distributed systems

[Encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore) seems nice.

## Notes

- Getting a million users is infinitely harder than scaling a system to handle a million users. Most systems could run comfortably on a Raspberry Pi
- [Fault-tolerant designs treat failures as routine. In large-scale systems, the assumption is that component failures will happen sooner or later. Any individual failure must be presumed imminent and component failures must be expected to be continuous.](https://twitter.com/bitfield/status/1418917382500794368)
