title: Conflict-free replicated data type
---

# [Conflict-free replicated data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)

[Liveblocks](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks) is a neat application of CRDTs. [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) is nice too. [CRDT wiki](https://crdt.tech/) is great.

## Notes

- [Distributed state is so fundamentally complex that I think we actually need CRDTs (or something like them) to reason about it effectively. And certainly to build reliable systems. The abstraction of a single, global, logical truth is so nice and tidy and appealing, but it becomes so leaky that I think all successful systems for distributed state will abandon it beyond a certain scale.](https://lobste.rs/s/9fufgr/i_was_wrong_crdts_are_future)
