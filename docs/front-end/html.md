# [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/kab/docs/Web/HTML)

## Notes

- As a general rule, if there will be only one such element on the page, you can use an id. Otherwise, use a class.
- [`<form method=post\>` is good to communicate a mutation.](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1370403183822921731)
- [When I work on a website, I set the body to contenteditable="true". This allows you to edit all text on the page, which I find helpful to improve the content, and also enables spell checking.](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/tzmqua/those_html_attributes_you_never_use/)
- `span is an inline div, it doesn't go to a new line`.
- `use span for text, div for everything else (buttons, lines etc.)`
- [HTML file inputs can access photos, videos, and audio captured directly by the device's camera](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1529437325792628736)
