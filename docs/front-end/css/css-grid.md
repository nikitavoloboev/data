# [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

[Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) is great intro. [CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) is useful tool.

## Notes

- [I use CSS grid in cases where I want strict column sizes with adaptive minmax sizes or where I want mobile layout to change in a pretty substantial way (grid-template-areas is far superior to flex in that regard)](https://twitter.com/gill_kyle/status/1472657149406760963)
