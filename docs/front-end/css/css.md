# [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

[Magic of CSS](https://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/) & [CSS for JS Developers](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js) are nice courses. [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) is neat overview of most common layouts. [Modern CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/), [Understanding Layout Algorithms](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/) & [Defensive CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/defensive-css/) are good reads. [Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/)'s blog is incredible.

Often use [these CSS loaders](https://uiball.com/loaders/). [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) are amazing. Trying out new features now from recent [State of CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy9ZXRRgpLk).

Recently been loving using [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/). [Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhIiI9Ld5M) is a must watch on building responsive websites.

## Nice templates

- [Stripe Homepage Website Made with Tailwind CSS](https://codepen.io/andreyazimov/pen/abWWeKp)

## Code

```css
<!-- unset styles -->
all: unset
```

## Notes

- [Grid for layout, Flexbox for components](https://ishadeed.com/article/grid-layout-flexbox-components/)
- ID's are unique.
  - Each element can have only one ID.
  - Each page can have only one element with that ID.
- Classes are NOT unique.
  - You can use the same class on multiple elements.
  - You can use multiple classes on the same element.
- [The DOM is just a tree of objects. CSS selects parts of that tree and applies attributes to those objects. It's all just code, it's just a shorthand for adding a bunch of attributes to a bunch of objects.](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/9jpvon/do_you_even_need_a_css_framework/)
- [Always design your CSS format from the inside out](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-prevent-divs-from-overlapping-I-have-3-divs-The-First-div-changes-its-size-and-overlaps-the-second-one-which-is-a-set-of-images)
  - format the elements within their container so that they look correct regardless of the size of the container.
  - similarly format those containers within their own containers
  - repeat until `<body>` is the containers
  - never use absolute widths (px, in, cm, etc.) for anything
- body tag takes up the whole width and height of the browser screen.
- [Hex colors are super common... and inconvenient as heck. Try hsl instead.](https://twitter.com/sulco/status/1295336749552537600)
- [If you make it a rule to always use attributes instead of classes to apply CSS to element states (not variants), you’ll force yourself to make your app more accessible (Similar to React Testing Library). If you’re using CSS-in-JS this also helps create more static styles.](https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1389225898193293313)
- [I feel like negative margins are probably the most under-used layout feature. Layouts become so much more manageable when an element's size in the document flow is decoupled from its visible size on screen.](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/1499139693652606977)
- [`overflow: clip` is faster than `overflow: hidden`](https://twitter.com/Steve8708/status/1503864654329958400)
- [If your site has a dark theme, make sure to set: `:root {color-scheme: dark}` So scroll bars are also dark.](https://twitter.com/diegohaz/status/1529543787311144961)
