# Learning

I love [Learney's approach to learning (show clear dependencies / track topics to learn / show best resources)](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1462921646575173633). [Feynman Technique](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1475096936395026434) is nice too. [Edrys](https://edrys.org/) seems like a nice learning platform.

## Notes

- [The internet provides access to an education that the aristocracy of old couldn't have imagined. It also provides the perfect attack vector for marketers to exploit cognitive vulnerabilities and dominate your attention. A world-class education is free for the undistractable.](https://twitter.com/TheStoicEmperor/status/1086118829661376512)
- [I can't imagine building intuition without the experience of writing your own stuff, reading a book isn't going to give you that, especially when it comes to just structuring code in general, if you really want to know how something works you have to write it](https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk/status/1256189125134336005)
- [Learning in public creates unpredictable but exceptional outcomes. Best way to LIP is to choose a creative container: a constrained format for sharing one’s learnings, released on a consistent schedule.](https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag/status/1292259847711477761)
- [Learning is not linear. You can “start anywhere” and branch out. It is much more important to be learning effectively (e.g. learn to recognize when you have a gap instead of trying random guesses until it works, and learn to ask the right questions).](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1295669401765720064)
- [It's incredible how much I was able to learn about myself and my craft by being an observer.](https://twitter.com/schlaf/status/1369466938448089088)
- [Something I try to be more mindful of these days is content-medium fit. "What medium is conducive to this kind of content" Teaching → Video workshops/webinars & blog posts. Storytelling → Podcasts. Chat/discussion → Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces. Coaching → Small group calls.](https://twitter.com/coreyhainesco/status/1377369107687870465)
- [The minute after you learn something is a really good time to start teaching.](https://twitter.com/jkup/status/1434280206567624705)
- [The problem with learning from experts is that they are so far removed from square one. Their material assumes some foundational knowledge. Newbies, don't be afraid to share what you're learning. From the beginning. We - even the experts - need your fresh perspective!](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1441794957543608324)
- [Building in Public let’s you leverage Cunningham’s Law to positive effect: if you error in your trial, someone is way more likely to pop out of the woodwork to tell you the right answer.](https://twitter.com/mikewavsz/status/1445627803550961669)
- [Explaining concepts in the chronological order they were developed is vastly overrated as a teaching strategy. Once we have the huge benefit of hindsight we should use that context to give better explanations in a logical order.](https://twitter.com/nick_r_cameron/status/1448227898935099392)
- [I think this is the real externality of having everything be algo-ranked for maximum engagement. I don't think many people are being polarized/radicalized politically. But we end up getting compacted into a more rigid version of ourselves in a thousand mundane ways. A partial cure has been to get myself back into reading books -- hard books. It is the only medium that can afford you a sufficient sense of occupying someone else's mind for a while when you're sick of yours. But somehow my attention span is shattered.](https://twitter.com/DanGrover/status/1443419300023263233)
- [Every act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer an injury to one’s self esteem.](https://twitter.com/mollyfmielke/status/1452658271190278144)
- [More “senior” engineers should do live coding or infra building exercises. You can read all about the basics in a book or online, but seeing a seasoned person tackle problems and handle exceptions in real time is the real gem.](https://twitter.com/bryanl/status/1455568889107128327)
- [I'm intensely skeptical of the idea that adulthood neuroplasticity dropoff is anywhere near as bad or preprogrammed as people think, you can stay plenty adaptable even without drugs by just, not letting yourself stop learning](https://twitter.com/alicemazzy/status/1507887402215432197)- [](https://twitter.com/alicemazzy/status/1507887402215432197)
