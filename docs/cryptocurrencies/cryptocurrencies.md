# Cryptocurrencies

I think [Solana](../databases/blockchain/solana.md)/[Tezos](../databases/blockchain/tezos.md)/[NEAR](../databases/blockchain/near.md)/[AVAX](https://www.avax.network/)/[Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/) are interesting [distributed consensus systems for transacting assets and running code](https://twitter.com/levie/status/1461099049461981189) ([smart contracts](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-solana-smart-contract/)). I find privacy coins/contracts like ([Monero](monero.md)/[SRCT](https://scrt.network/)/[IronFish](https://ironfish.network/)) to be most interesting use cases of crypto right now. Especially considering the [amount of power governments have to cut you fully from traditional banking system](https://twitter.com/cyprianous/status/1493414970976980992). [There are no other constitutional rights in substance without freedom to transact.](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1495074449883762688)

It's unfortunate that a lot of people/projects use these distributed ledgers as [ponzi schemes](https://twitter.com/eddyb_r/status/1451679543702478860) or [wash trading](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1461301086363529219) or still use [super wasteful consensus systems](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1350869944888664064) (like [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md)). Some [argue that blockchains are useless tech all together](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30310317). Worst of all, many treat crypto as a [way to purely make money with no regulation](https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1524512164240797696) and that poisons interaction & discourse all around as they try to [sell you on the value of often worthless coins](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1522284917698473984) and generally be annoying.

I hold few coins only as a way to build unique apps, not for investment purposes (I think there are [better investments](../economy/investing.md) to be made that help move us to a [better future](../future/future.md)). I don't know what the world, that at least partly, starts to rely on passing state in decentralized way without any reversal of transactions. It seems hard to imagine how this can work well. But I am optimistic. I do think having powerful open source protocols is very powerful compared to the current status quo of opaque systems that only few humans have control of.

From my research, [FTX](https://ftx.com/referrals#a=58425911) seemed to be the cheapest way to trade coins for FIAT but I maybe wrong. Ideally everyone moves to completely P2P marketplaces where fees are minimal and no one can block your ability to transact.

## Notes

- [The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. What actually matters is making goods & providing services. We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. Whichever has least error & latency will win.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704)
- [China launches digital yuan. Adopted by nations tired of SWIFT abuse. Suddenly US can’t impose sanctions. Shift from apathy to panic, like COVID. But DC can’t build. So they deputize private USD stablecoins. And that is how a digital dollar may be born.](https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1395722987966455811)
- [Rich people buy tons very low and wait till it rises high sell all for tons of profit...Then retail investors get scared and sell there coins making it drop way further than what the rich guys took profit...Next they buy tons again at a even cheaper price and get a lot more coins for there money...Rises high again then Repeat......Vicious cycle but this is the little guys opportunity to get a leg up.

- [One of the most obvious flaws in using blockchains for anything involving regular human beings is one I've not seen much discussion of: Regular human beings cannot protect their passwords, credentials or private keys. They just can't. The idea of encouraging anyone who doesn't have a deep understanding of personal information security to attach a sizable portion of their net worth to an irreversible "code is law" distributed system is utterly appalling.](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1444071543902912513)
