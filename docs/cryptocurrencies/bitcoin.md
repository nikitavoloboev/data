# [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)

Bitcoin is a [complete environmental disaster](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1350869944888664064) which made history for being the [first true digital cryptocurrency](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) (solved double spending issue in decentralized way). [Solana](../databases/blockchain/solana.md)/[Tezos](../databases/blockchain/tezos.md) are a more efficient and more powerful versions of Bitcoin due to Bitcoin's [wasteful & slow transactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0HC1Udk6-E) and [horrible PoW consensus algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4). Hopefully soon [all energy wasting crypto mining gets banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/qriryh/sweden_asks_european_union_to_ban_cryptocurrency/).

## Notes

- [Bitcoin is both trust-minimized (even more than gold) yet quite unlike gold digital & easily transferable in its trust-minimized form. It's an unprecedentedly superior form of money, but like anything else new traded in a free market, its historical journey starts off volatile.](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1328759197769502722)
- [At this point, of all the things Bitcoin can do that other financial assets can't (pseudo-anonymous, extremely hard to confiscate, can be moved quasi instantaneously across borders, demonstrably finite supply, can be use as a settlement layer for large players, etc ...) the one aspect that I believe attracts people is "store of value". Many people contest that last property citing high volatility, and they're correct if your window is less than 4 years. But for folks who play the long game, supply and demand tells a very compelling story for Bitcoin.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25157946)
