# Linear algebra

## Notes

- Lots of matrices don't have an inverse.
- [It is useful to simply think of matrices as systems of linear equations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathmemes/comments/rosrel/linear_algebra_in_a_nutshell/)
- [Seeing the derivative operator represented as a matrix, acting over the polynomial vector space can open your eyes. Taking the determinant of that matrix shows that d/dx isn't invertible. Thinking of the fixed point of the transformation yields exp, the eigenfunction of the operator.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30866244)
