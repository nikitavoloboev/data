title: VS Code

# [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)

My favorite editor that I use to write code in. I use [many extensions](vs-code-extensions.md) for it.

My config for it can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode/settings.json).

I use VS Code [GitHub theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) with [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font. Here is how it looks:

I switch between GitHub Light and GitHub Dark themes as I change between macOS appearances.

## Notes

- [VS Code is architected in a way where extensions are not eagerly activated by default. Each extension can declare a list of activation events, such as e.g. opening a file of a certain language, invoking a specific command, starting debugging, etc.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16940419)
- `Developer: Show Running Extensions` command -> Shows currently running extensions. Is good for profiling.
- [VS Code has excellent integrated node debugging. It integrates seamlessly with the entire tool ecosystem (eg I use ts-node-dev for autoreloading + typescript support, and the VS Code debugger Just Works). And because it's inside the editor, ndb features like the ability to put breakpoints in a file before it is required are irrelevant. It's all at your fingertips, just put a breakpoint right where you're coding, hit F5 to attach the debugger to your devserver and step through the code.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17581521)
- To hide non useful `Outline` section in sidebar, just open the context menu on the outline section's header and select the "Hide" action.
- [Can use "\*" in the advanced search options in @code to search for similar subfolders across multiple parent folders.](https://twitter.com/SteveGodderidge/status/1285978384049348609)
