# Text editors

[Vim](vim/vim.md), [Sublime Text](sublime-text/sublime-text.md) and [VS Code](vs-code/vs-code.md) are my favorite editors.

Vim for its text editing and the _vim language_ and VS code for giving me the best of both worlds. The awesome [Vim plugin](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) and the amazing IDE like features. And Sublime Text for its speed and the awesome [vim emulation](https://github.com/guillermooo/Six).

[Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) & [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) are nice web editors. [Zed](https://zed.dev/) seems promising.

## Notes

- [Zas Editor uses text-storage data structure, syntax highlighting and search features are written in Rust, and the UI is written in Swift since we wanted to create a native macOS experience. The Swift and Rust code talk to each other using C FFI, and no, that doesn’t take away the safety features of both languages. We’re using the Rope data structure for text representation, and the tree-sitter parser for syntax highlighting and some smart features like file outline, local renaming and symbol search. All other language features are powered by LSP servers (rust-analzyer and gopls).](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30952084)
