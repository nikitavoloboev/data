# [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

The best text editing experience you will ever get. It is worth learning it as you will start thinking about text editing differently.

I use some kind of vim bindings in any app I use and if there is a vim plugin for the app, I often use it. I use vim editor often when connecting to remote sessions and when I need a console editor.

I use [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) instead of vim and my vimrc can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/init.vim). And [here](vim-plugins.md) are all the plugins I use with it.

I switch between Ayu Light and Ayu Mirage themes as I change between macOS appearances.

> Ayu Mirage

I also use a little trick where I change the cursor from thin block in insert mode to underline when in normal mode. This lets me quickly know which mode I am in.

## Notes

- I can profile vim startup time with [startuptime](https://github.com/tweekmonster/startuptime.vim).
- I can run `:CheckHealth` to see if there is anything wrong with my installation (only Neovim).
- Get plugins that meet your needs.
- You're more likely to find useful plugins if you approach it the other way around: I want to do X, vim can't do it nicely by itself, which plugin can help me do it.
- If something doesn't work in vimrc, put the binding in the bottom of vimrc (perhaps something overrides it).
- [I care about reducing friction, and Vim's editing language is very good at that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/hg37kq/question_how_much_time_do_you_save_using_vim/)
