# Computer graphics

[Vulkan](vulkan.md) and [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) seem great.

## Notes

- [To get started in 3d graphics all you really need to understand is how to multiply a bunch of 4x4 matrices together. From there it is a matter of learning how to put that to good effect.](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/9sknxm/what_are_you_working_on/e8q82ug/)
