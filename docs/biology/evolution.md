# Evolution

## Notes

- [If you work with any kind of evolutionary system or neural networks or meta-optimizers (Like Schmidhuber's Gödel machine) there comes a point when you realize that "intelligence", whatever it is, should be expected to arise. Evolution and meta-evolution proceed at the same time in life, so intelligence should be ambient in Nature.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18709749)
- [Evolution cares about one thing: do we have children and raise them to a point of self-sufficiency. Any time the answer is "no," natural selection will correct this or the species will go extinct. Any time the answer is "yes," natural selection says "Good enough!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/stc8wa/70_of_women_cannot_orgasm_from_piv_sex_even_after/)
