## Notes

- The body is always trying to maintain homeostasis by either allowing or removing certain particles/molecules/chemicals/compounds/..
- [We must form the habit ... of viewing the shape of a given cell, tissue, or organ not as a static feature but as a phase, transitory or terminal, in a continuous chain of transformations; as a cross section through a stream of processes proceeding in time.](https://twitter.com/drmichaellevin/status/1267563603894218754)
- [Neurons do not divide, so when a neuron dies, the body has no mechanism to replace it. Peripheral nervous system has the capacity for regeneration and repair, while the central nervous system does not. However, this means that the peripheral neuron must survive the trauma being inflicted, as if the damage is severe or close to the cell body, it may die. However, if the cell body remains intact, then severed axons of peripheral nerves can be regenerated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Foregen/comments/tt7hgq/i_had_learned_in_high_school_biology_classes_that/)
- [If nerve cells could never reproduce, you would never regain feeling after you skinned your knees, but you do. From what I understand, nerve damage to the brain and spine are irreparable. The spine and brain nerves are called CNS (central nervous system) and the nerves in your skin, bones and soft tissues are called PNS (peripheral nervous system.).](https://www.reddit.com/r/Foregen/comments/tt7hgq/i_had_learned_in_high_school_biology_classes_that/)
- [Nerve cells have axons, which are long tails that allow their synapses to be very far from the nerve body. In the case of our sensory nerves, those axons can be over a meter long. Imagine a touch receptor on your fingertip. That touch receptor connects to a synapse that's connected to an axon that runs all the way up your arm and into your spine, where the nerve body is located. If the axon is cut, the nerve cell itself does not die. This is why body parts that are reattached are capable of regaining sensation: the actual nerve itself has not died; it simply needs to regrow its axons. This growth is slow, iirc on the order of a centimeter a month, but it happens. This is also why spinal injuries are so devastating; because there, the bodies of nerve cells are being destroyed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Foregen/comments/tt7hgq/i_had_learned_in_high_school_biology_classes_that/)
