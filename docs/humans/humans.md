# Humans

Being a human myself, I can't but be amazed and inspired by what other people have both created before me and are creating right now.

I have many interests and I find studying and looking into people who have spent their time studying some of these topics is a really good investment of my time. It's also quite amazing that nowadays you can potentially message a person whose work you like and sometimes they can respond.

I maintain a list of [awesome humans](https://github.com/learn-anything/humans) across different disciplines.

## Notes

- [Build a list of people you want to work with someday. ~100% of them will be unavailable when you write their names down. You'll probably believe you'll never actually get a chance to work with >80% of them. Keep at it long enough and you'll be stunned by how wrong you were.](https://twitter.com/julianweisser/status/1292077164645367808)
