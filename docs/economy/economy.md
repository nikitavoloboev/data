# Economy

[What is Money, Anyway?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30825505) is good intro article to economics. And [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/ujm39z/whats_the_best_route_to_learn_a_solid_foundation/) is a nice thread with more resources.

## Notes

- Capitalism = making money through ownership of capital rather than purely by labour.
- Desire is suffering. Advertising induces desire to generate economic activity, and so could be construed as a form of paid torture.
  - We're kept on the "hamster wheel" by a carrot, not a stick.
  - It is undeniably true that we don't need the overwhelming majority of things consume be happy. People have found happiness without being rampant consumers for thousands of years. Unfortunately, advertising has directly influenced people's ability to find happiness without consumption. The problem is not everyone can consume everything they believe is required to be happy. Furthermore, many people give up work/life balance or go into debt-slavery in order to try and consume their way to happiness. As a result, people who might otherwise be happy are made unhappy by in significant part by advertising.
    - Even worse, if you actually do reach your consumption quota, you find it doesn't make cause lasting happiness. Most people infer that the answer is to consume more, and they end up killing themselves on the hedonic treadmill.

- [Hyperinflation would generally only occur if the US was using "printed money" to pay debt, which it isn't doing. It's using the money to invest in individuals and to create private capital. The theory goes that the money is not just paid back (in the form of tax revenue) but is actually paid back with a positive return.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/mk2fem/10mall_in_index_funds/)

- [Banks can only deal in the currency of their country. So if someone has US dollars in a bank, that money is in a US bank. EU dollars, in an EU Bank. Just because you might have EU in your US account doesn't mean the money is in a US bank. It's in a EU bank that your US bank is partnered with. Money basically never leaves a countries banking system. This is why sanctions work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/szs1co/putincrash_moscow_stock_exchange_signs_the_worst/)
