# Skin care

Often times my skin care routine is just having a shower in morning or evening with a [moisturizer applied](https://instanatural.com/products/vitamin-c-moisturizer).

When I go out for long times, especially when it's sunny, I apply [some sunscreen](https://instanatural.com/pages/vitamin-c-moisturizer-with-spf-30).

I try and never touch my face with dirty hands together with minimizing frowning. I am overall quite happy so that part is easy.
