# Supplements

Supplements I sometimes take are inspired by [Rhonda Patrick](https://fastlifehacks.com/dr-rhonda-patricks-supplements-list/).

- [Magnesium](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thorne-Research-Magnesium-Citramate-Vegetarian/dp/B0797SJ88Y) (1 capsule)
- [Vitamin D3](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Supplement-Absorption-Cholecalciferol-Nu-Nutrition/dp/B01NC3DJK7) (1 capsule)
- [Vegan Omega 3 DHA & EPA](https://www.amazon.com/VEGAN-OMEGA-Supplement-Cardiovascular-Supplements/dp/B01MYE95BQ) (1 capsule)
- [Lions Mane](https://oriveda.co.uk/lions-mane.php) (1 capsule)

From these, Magnesium & Vitamin D3 are the more important supplements.

I try to minimize the number of things my body has to process to bare essentials so more often than not I don't take any supplements. I maximize the quality of food I eat by eating [natural whole food plant based food](foods.md). I also fast but not routinely.

And I enjoy taking [psychedelics](../../drugs/psychedelics/psychedelics.md) once in few months. Tryptamines being my favorite.

## Interesting

Some maybe interesting supplements I don't take routinely but tried.

- [Multivitamin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Multivitamins-Multivitamin-Vegetarians-Nu-Nutrition/dp/B01IFGDNVS) (1 capsule)
- [Sulforaphane](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jarrow-Formulas-Broccomax-Vcaps-Capsules/dp/B01D15LMCK) (1 capsule)

## Didn't try but have interesting nutrients

- [Daily Thyroid Care Supplement](https://www.palomahealth.com/product/thyroid-supplements)

## Notes

- [Pregnant women taking 1,000 mg of the omega-3 DHA had 50% fewer early preterm births than women given 200 mg. The high dose DHA also reduced feeding issues and genitourinary and neurologic problems in infants (randomized controlled trial).](https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1397251661618352133)
- [Recent study suggests anti inflammatory meds contribute to chronic pain by preventing an inflammatory process that resets the pain baseline. We have been using these for decades and didnâ€™t catch this. This should make you nervous about playing Guinea pig.](https://twitter.com/karnagraha/status/1528490268546068480)
