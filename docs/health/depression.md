# Depression

Depression is a natural emotion that is caused by your body's response to the unpleasant environment you are in.

I try my best to mindfully be aware of emotions, thoughts and feelings I have and focus on improving my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) in life.

## Notes

- [Jealousy is natural. You are not a terrible person for feeling jealous. That feeling of jealousy is your responsibility to find ways to work with. And you can find ways to work with it.](https://twitter.com/gildedspine/status/1291863161486880770)
- [Burnout is a response to repeated attempts to make meaningful change while lacking the agency to do so. See problems > try to fix them > get shot down or ignored.](https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1292971874570256385)
- [You are not “burnt out”. You are exploited, overworked & underpaid. Use language that accurately describes the underlying problem. Your body isn't broken; the conditions you're enduring are what's broken. Your body is accurately & normally responding to exploitation.](https://twitter.com/Hood_Biologist/status/1387941182781771777)
- [Sometimes I feel worn out by the world. Then I remember that with just a small amount of effort and curiosity, life is so unbelievably rich, abundant, fascinating, challenging, and inspiring. The rabbit holes are infinite and impossibly deep. Find a loose thread and pull it.](https://twitter.com/jacksondahl/status/1410052629602783232)
- [Psychedelic mushrooms increase neuroplasticity, allowing restructuring of neural connections. Essentially, you can "rewrite" your brain away from depressive thoughts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/prz8z5/a_bit_skeptical_about_shrooms_helping_with/)
- [Feelings come and go. Consequences last.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVgQ_tgWMyU)
- You can process my emotions through a different lenses. It’s truly normal to grieve the loss of something or someone. While many don’t understand, I think as long as WE know what we are dealing with, that can make life a little easier.
