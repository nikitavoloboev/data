# Animals

I love all animals. And I am sad that some people decide to eat them and not [let them live a fulfilling & happy life](../environment/veganism.md).

## Notes

- [Dogs evolved to live with humans when we had very different lifestyles. Most people no longer have lives and jobs which align with the social & mental needs of a dog. That leads to a very one sided relationship where the dog's needs get overly relegated or neglected. Therefore most people shouldn't own a dog, especially not just one.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29055956)
