# Negotiating

## Notes

- [Start off with a strong position, then negotiate back to the place where you want it to be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/5qtyh1/as_a_british_citizen_that_was_born_in_iraq_is/dd29nmy/)
- In short:
  1. Know what result you want.
  2. Propose your result + a ton of wild unreasonable additions.
  3. Your opponent gets all disheveled by the unreasonable additions.
  4. You 'compromise' by walking back to what you want. You opponent gets a win and you get what you wanted all along.

- [Never overplay your hand when negotiating a major deal -- especially not against a stronger player. There are ways to be a strong negotiator without lying.](https://twitter.com/apartovi/status/1447253292686270467)
- [A deal isn’t done until it’s closed. No matter how much you want to be on the same side of the table as the other party, don’t show your cards until the game is over. Be patient and learn when to keep your mouth shut.](https://twitter.com/apartovi/status/1449858945942794245)
