# Biases

## Interesting

- [Dunning–Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect) - The less you know about something, the more likely you are to think there isn't much to know about it.
- [Negativity bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) - Notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things. In theory it protects you to from forgetting things that could harm you, and helps you notice potentially dangerous situations.
