# Talks

I love watching interesting talks on various subjects. I also love making talks and presenting in front of people.

I once made TEDx talk on mindfulness. I only have a transcript of it [here](http://telegra.ph/TED-Talk---Mindfulness-March-2016-03-28). I hope to give more talks of my own soon.

I mark talks that I found interesting [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/talks). For tech talks/screencasts I make, I like the format of showing it as pre-made tabs to go through ([example talk](https://youtu.be/zED9ePuht4g?t=24929)).

## Notes

- Giving a talk, it is often best to start with a `Why?`
- [I love the virtual conf format of "play pre-recorded video while speaker engages with the audience in chat". As a speaker, I enjoy interacting with the audience this way throughout the entire talk, and being able to answer questions without losing any speaking time.](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1294355241412878336)
- [Give a roadmap whenever you start speaking. Signpost every argument. Explicitly state the implications of your arguments. Good debaters talk about facts, great ones talk about framing.](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1307493332285825024)
- [My number one tip for giving conference talks: you're telling a story. Don't just read bullet points from slides!](https://twitter.com/ASpittel/status/1420731057851281417)
- [The most effective presentation skill is backchanneling, which is where you shop your idea to each stakeholder well ahead of time and get verbal buy-in. Presenting then becomes a cake walk because it'll essentially be a formality.](https://twitter.com/lilykonings/status/1479546213573685248)
