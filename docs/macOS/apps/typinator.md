# [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/)

Used the app [previously](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/blob/27bdf4e90829c7f5fafe61fdaf57f0d13a2d15ed/macOS/apps/typinator.md) to automate text expansions. Now use [Alfred](alfred/alfred.md) (simple expansions) & [Keyboard Maestro](keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro.md) (complex) instead.

## Notes

- You can press ⌥ + ⌫ to delete snippet without dialogue box.
