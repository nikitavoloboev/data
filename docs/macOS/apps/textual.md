# [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)

I like IRC even though Discord is a strictly superior experience. I currently use Matrix and [Element](https://element.io) client to connect to IRC Freenode channels I care about.

In Textual, when I did use it, I used Geeza Pro Regular 18pt font & built in Tomorrow Night (Eighties) theme.

Textual has great channel search feature.

One day I hope someone makes a solid macOS native client for Matrix that has all the features and speed of Textual.

## Notes

- I can inspect HTML of the window by going to `HELP -> Advanced -> Enter Developer Mode` and then right clicking on what I want to inspect.
- Right click on chat background and `Force Reload Style` will reapply the styles you made in the active theme (as well as the JS code).
- CMD + enter when typing will render text as `/me` command. OPT + CMD will allow to write multi line text.
- Can jump instantly to a channel using url scheme. With `Developer Mode` enabled, right click on channel and `Copy Unique Identifier`. Then open URL (in KM) like `textual://goto/2F49204B-971F-4016-920B-CC15A308581C` where the thing after `goto/` is the id.
- ⌥⌘U = hide right sidebar.
