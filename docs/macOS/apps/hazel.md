# [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com)

I once used Hazel to sort things in `~/Downloads` folder.

You can [sync Hazel rules](https://www.noodlesoft.com/manual/hazel/work-with-folders-rules/manage-rules/sync-rules/) with Dropbox.

## Notes

- If you want to have your rules to be applied onto subfolders as well as the directory chosen, add this rule.

- If extensions are hidden, don't add extensions in the rule editor too.
