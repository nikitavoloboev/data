# macOS

[macOS is incredible as a personal OS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os). Would love to join Apple and contribute to the OS at some point. [Karabiner](apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) is life changing.

## Clean install

You can clean install by going to Recovery mode (restart with `cmd+r` pressed). Then Disk Utility > Select disk > Erase (Format it) > Close Disk Utility > Select option Reinstall MacOS (Choose macOS ver. to install).

## Notes

- In save dialogues I can press these keys:
  - `Return` or `⌘ + S` = Save
  - `ESC` = Cancel
- I can also press `/` or `~` to quickly go to some directory from a save dialogue. And I can press `⌘ + ↑` to go to `parent directory`.
- Recovery mode: Power off the machine, press the power button and immediately hold Cmd-R.
- [Both Windows and MacOS are at a point where clean installs are unnecessary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/90g4h9/is_it_worth_the_effort_to_do_a_clean_install_of/)
  - I can appreciate someone wanting to do a clean install if they've installed and removed many apps and just want to clear out everything spread around all the system and hidden folders, even if it doesn't really affect performance and won't save a ton of disk space. There is something cathartic about a clean install.
- `/usr/local/bin` is a good place to put raw binaries available in the path, that are not installed with Nix.

- [Can select text from middle of link's text by holding down alt while you drag and select with the mouse](https://twitter.com/MBoffin/status/1218668903586394112)
- [plutil tool support the generation of Swift or Objective-C code directly from plists. For example: plutil -convert swift.](https://twitter.com/dmartincy/status/1295029196503351298)
- [To code sign binaries ad hoc, run `codesign -s - <path_to_binary>`.](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42684) This will give users a gatekeeper warning but they could still run the binary. To sign so users can run binary without warning, you need Apple developer account.
- [I basically install nothing except GUI apps on my Mac. I don’t even have a bashrc (or any shell rc for that matter). I never open the terminal on Mac. I live in the VM for dev work, and use GUI apps like calendar, email, messages, browser, etc. on Mac.](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1449151623092060164)

- [Just because a root certificate is in the built-in iOS/macOS trust store doesn't mean that it is trusted. Apple applies additional constraints via configuration updates to maintain a high-level of security.](https://twitter.com/BasileBailey/status/1494801237694300161)
