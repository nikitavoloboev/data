# Documentation

Use [Docusaurus](../tools/docusaurus.md) for any custom documentation I need to write. [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io/) & [nbdoc](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1507383929774305282) look nice too.

[React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) is a great example of what great docs are. I love their illustrations.
