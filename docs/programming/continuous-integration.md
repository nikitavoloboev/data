# Continuous Integration

[Dagger](https://dagger.io/) seems nice.

## Notes

- [Fully-automated seamless CI/CD is the goal.](https://twitter.com/fuzzychef/status/1369325657084289029)
- [At Stripe my PR is often reviewed within 10 minutes. That makes a huge difference for shipping fast.](https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/1400511441556459523)
- [I feel like if I’m sitting on someone’s PR, I’m blocking them from moving forward. Rarely the case, but it’s a good motivator.](https://twitter.com/destroytoday/status/1400593283395555328)
- [The real missing part for CI/CD automation is a local development experience. Sounds counter-intuitive but being able to run the E2E CI/CD pipeline locally and validate failures saves engineers from the 20 minute push, coffee, failure, fix loop.](https://twitter.com/retrohack3r/status/1550195052730691585)
