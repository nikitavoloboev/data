# State machines

[XState](../tools/xstate.md) is great.

## Notes

- [Most apps: Enable all user actions by default. Bugs will come from the things you didn't think about. State machines: Disable all user actions by default. Bugs come from happy paths you forgot about.](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1524085641390313474)
