# Serialization

## Interesting formats

- [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) - Like JSON but smaller and faster. ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22537250)) ([Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/9kd4o9/messagepack_it_s_like_json_fast_small))
- [MessagePack implementation for C and C++](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c)
- [FlatBuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers) - Cross platform serialization library architected for maximum memory efficiency.
- [Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) - Allows you to define data types and service interfaces in a simple definition file. ([Code](https://github.com/apache/thrift))
- [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flexbuffers.html) - Was designed around schemas, because when you want maximum performance and data consistency, strong typing is helpful. ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23588558))
- [Binn](https://github.com/liteserver/binn) - Binary data serialization format designed to be compact, fast and easy to use.
- [KDL Document Language](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl) - Meant to be used both as a serialization format and a configuration language, much like JSON, YAML, or XML.
