# Git

I love Git and version control. And I use version control over any project I do. I follow a [series of rules](../../focusing/rules.md#git) when dealing with Git. [Josh](https://github.com/josh-project/josh) seems neat. [Think Like Git](https://tacaswell.github.io/think-like-git.html) is a great read.

## Notes

- Commit as often as you can. Ideally after each micro-iteration, when something new is working.
  - This way, at the end of the day you can just rebase the whole branch and squash all of the micro-commits in a whole commit implementing the whole new features.
- Good git workflow to make changes to new projects: clone, fork (`hub fork`), 'git checkout -b my-feature', work, commit, 'git push -u nikitavoloboev my-feature', work, commit, 'git push'.
- If you’re doing things right, there’s only two kinds of branches anyways, master and feature branches. Feature branches can be squashed and rebased off master (minimizing the issue of merge conflicts and making for easier management of the commit history) and merged to master from there without requiring further conflict resolution. ([Trunk-Based Development](https://paulhammant.com/2013/04/05/what-is-trunk-based-development/))
- A Git branch is just a pointer to a commit. Git commits, however, also contain the hash of the parent commit(s), so by referring to that commit you also refer too all ancestors.
- Squash + rebase (for feature branches) are good for PRs. No one cares that it took you 20 tries to get the feature right, what matters is what went into the pull request, which is usually one commit.
- [To me the beauty of git stems from the fact that it is an implementation of a functional data structure. It‘s a tree index that is read-only, and updating it involves creating a complete copy of the tree and giving it a new name. Then the only challenge is to make that copy as cheap as possible - for which the tree lends itself, as only the nodes on the path to the root need to get updated. As a result, you get lock-free transactions (branches) and minimal overhead. It is so beautiful in fact that when I think about systems that need to maintain long-running state in concurrent environments, my first reaction is ”split up the state into files, and maintain it through git“.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21418033)
- [PRs with mandatory review within a company are a bit of an antipattern/red flag IMO. Cycle time automatically gets long. Even when pairing, changes can be put up for review if the authors want more feedback, so it's not a binary choice.](https://twitter.com/sanityinc/status/1313206571606978560)

## Code

```bash
# set new git remote origin (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16330404/how-to-remove-remote-origin-from-a-git-repository)
git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here

# Cleanup .git http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-12/msg00165.html
git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250

# Reset to previous commit
git reset HEAD~

# Reset to commit
git reset <commit hash> --hard

# Checkout previous commit
git checkout HEAD~

# Create new branch
git checkout -b

# Revert changes to modified files (working changes)
git reset --hard

# New branch without git history & files
git checkout --orphan

# Show where git configs get defined
git config --show-origin -l

# Undo last commit but don't throw away changes
git reset --soft HEAD^

# List all git submodules
git submodule--helper list

# Pull from PR
git pull origin pull/<issue ID>/head

# List remote branches
git branch -a

# Delete branch
git branch -d

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete

# Force overwrite git repo. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10510462/force-git-push-to-overwrite-remote-files
git push -f <remote> <branch>

# Reset to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit>

# Remove dir from git
git rm --cached -r <dir>

# Rename previous commit
git commit --amend

# Force push overwrite
git push --force origin master

# Hard reset a branch
git reset --hard <branch-name>

# Change remote. i.e. when making a fork of a clone to change upstream destination.
git remote rename origin upstream; git remote rename nikitavoloboev origin

# Change upstream to my name so it pushes there
git branch --set-upstream-to nikitavoloboev/master master

# Show changes between commits. Where f5352 and be73 are unique commit hashes.
git diff f5352 be73

# Update submodule
git submodule update

# Set PGP key for Git globally. <key> = fingerprint w/o spaces
git config --global user.signingkey <key>

# Clone git repo without history (much faster)
git clone [REPO] --depth 1

# Move your unstaged changes to a new branch (https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1479129404500594691)
git switch -c <branch-name>

# Remove sensitive info committed (https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/master/Commands.md#git-obliterate)
git obliterate <>

```

```bash
# Delete commit from remote.

# 1. Delete commit from local repo
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# 2. Delete commit from remote repo (can get commit using git log)
git push -f origin last_known_good_commit:branch_name
```

### Change old commit message

```bash
#
# It is bad practice to rewrite history. Works best if no one has pushed commits on top of remote branch you want to rewrite history of.

# 1. Rebase to commit you want to change (~1 means the first ancestor of the specified commit)
git rebase -i <hash>~1

# Can also do this
git rebase -i HEAD~4 # where HEAD~4 = last 3 commits

# 2. Rename pick to reword (in opened editor) & save/quit

# 3. Change commit message in editor and save

# 4. Overwrite and remove duplicate commits
git push --force-with-lease
```

### [Quickly pull down PRs](https://davidwalsh.name/5-essential-git-commands-and-utilities)

```bash
git config --global --add alias.pr '!f() { git fetch -fu ${2:-upstream} refs/pull/$1/head:pr/$1 && git checkout pr/$1; }; f'

git config --global --add alias.pr-clean '!git checkout master ; git for-each-ref refs/heads/pr/* --format="%(refname)" | while read ref ; do branch=${ref#refs/heads/} ; git branch -D $branch ; done'
```
