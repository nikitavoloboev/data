title: Software architecture
---

# [Software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)

I love the idea of [building truly offline first software where backend failing isn't a big deal. All operations are done locally (fast), then sync deltas to server](https://twitter.com/_vojto/status/1466540419404247043). Like [Replicache](https://replicache.dev/). Good example of such app is [Linear](https://linear.app/).

My current preferred stack is [NextJS/Prisma/Postgres/PostGraphile with some Go/Deno services](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29627047). [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](https://aosabook.org/en/index.html) has nice architecture insights.

## Inspiration

### Other

- [Things Network Stack for LoRaWAN V3](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack) - Lovely contribution + github & git flow + good docs.
- [Deno Website](https://github.com/denoland/deno_website2)
- [gh CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)

## Notes

- [Two traits of a good architecture: 1. It should nudge you to do things in a scalable way by default. You should only pay for what you use. 2. When something gets slow, there should be a straightforward way to fix it.](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1251864460526006273)
- [Tips to build a better software system](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24388753)
  1. Incremental improvement - implement a small version that works in a basic use case, then extend. Don't build it all in once.
  2. Reuse code. Don't reinvent the wheel
  3. Five whys - get to the root cause of why something should be done by asking yourself why many times. Understand the problem well before acting.
  4. Keep the solution as simple as possible. Minimization.
  5. Perfection can't be reached, so don't aim there. Be as good as necessary.
  6. Postpone complexity and introduce it only when really needed.
- [Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction, it's true. The right abstraction is still cheaper than both of those. Sometimes it's so much cheaper I've seen people build entire businesses from one insight. Duplicate where appropriate but don't stop hunting for the pattern.](https://twitter.com/krisajenkins/status/1440260166637658118)
- [Real-time local sync engine is very important in providing great user experiences.](https://twitter.com/cjbell_/status/1450881390292127758)
