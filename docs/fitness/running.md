# Running

## Notes

- [80% of your runs should be at 20% effort and 20% of them at 80% effort. Obviously the specifics will differ per person, but the big idea is taking it easy on most of your runs. Running slower for longer is better for your training than running faster for shorter. One more way to think about it: running slower for longer is like doing low weight/high rep lifting workouts as opposed to short sprints which would be max weight/low rep/to failure lifting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n8dbqj/can_i_replace_cardio_with_body_weight_exercise/)
- [Going slower isn’t only good for addressing excessive fatigue (some fatigue does not mean you’re doing it wrong), but also leads to physiological adaptations that don’t occur (or take longer) when you’re always running fast. Pushing hard is fun. But it becomes more fun if your body adapts after more slow aerobic base building.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n8dbqj/can_i_replace_cardio_with_body_weight_exercise/)
- [Can also do active rest, which will help more with recovery. Incorporate some short (20-30 minute) walks, stretching, and/or some light yoga.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n8dbqj/can_i_replace_cardio_with_body_weight_exercise/)
