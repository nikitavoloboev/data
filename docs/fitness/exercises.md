## Notes

- [For humans: Doing any exercise is better than doing no exercise. Doing frequent exercise is better than doing infrequent exercise. The most important thing is to pick an exercise that you enjoy, so you'll be more likely to get out and do it and less likely to come up with excuses to skip a day. Even better: Find an exercise that includes some social activity, even if it's just getting outside and seeing other people in passing as you run past or being in a gym near other people. Social exposure is great for mental health, so combining it with exercise is a good one-two punch.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26741776)
