# Sex

[Sex for over 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/) & [HLCommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/HLCommunity/) are fun subs to read. [David Buss's interview on Sex, Dating, Relationships, and Sex Differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sndW9hzX-wA) was fascinating.

## Notes

- [Don't have PIV sex immediately as it can be painful and unpleasant. Foreplay is important. Be gentle. Can give her an orgasm without any PIV involved easily.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/mehb1d/why_is_there_this_weird_perception_that_the_sex/)

- [Take foreplay slower. It can happen early on and at any part of the day through compliments or light touches. The key to having a nice sexual experience is when everyone is fully relaxed, nothing is rushed and everything feels natural and not forced. Communicate everything.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/comments/n39rs9/what_is_he_hitting_that_feels_so_good_aspot_or/)
