# Sex

[Sex for over 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/) & [HLCommunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/HLCommunity/) are fun subs to read. [David Buss's interview on Sex, Dating, Relationships, and Sex Differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sndW9hzX-wA) was fascinating.

## Notes

- [Don't have PIV sex immediately as it can be painful and unpleasant. Foreplay is important. Be gentle. Can give her an orgasm without any PIV involved easily.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/mehb1d/why_is_there_this_weird_perception_that_the_sex/)
- [Going off birth control often increases sex drive. But increases chances of conception dramatically.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/mgliwt/i_went_off_of_birth_control_and_dear_god/)
- [There is no such thing as vaginal orgasm, only clitoral.](https://www.abc.net.au/health/features/stories/2014/10/28/4116350.htm)
- [Female birth control often has negative side effects on the body. Ideally research into male contraception that's not just condoms/vasectomy. IUD seems like the best least problematic contraceptive method.](https://twitter.com/nwilliams030/status/1381421499005943810)
- [Take foreplay slower. It can happen early on and at any part of the day through compliments or light touches. The key to having a nice sexual experience is when everyone is fully relaxed, nothing is rushed and everything feels natural and not forced. Communicate everything.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/comments/n39rs9/what_is_he_hitting_that_feels_so_good_aspot_or/)
- [Women's desire usually drives from a story being played out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/comments/t2xr2p/any_advice_on_how_to_make_yourself_want_to_have/)
