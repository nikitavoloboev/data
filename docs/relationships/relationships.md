# Relationships

Below is what I think is a nice overview of my thoughts on what I think makes for successful and happy relationships of any kind but especially romantic.

I am 27 now so I have a lot to learn still but I genuinely just want to be a nice person and maximize the amount of fun and novel experiences I get to live through in this life. Below list I think maximizes that goal in some broad strokes systematic way. I have some [other rules](../focusing/rules.md) I note down too that help me a lot.

> At the end of the day people won't remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.

**1. Be honest. Be kind. Be empathetic.**

Put above in short because I think it summarizes everything well. You have to be honest and communicate everything. A conflict is not you fighting with another person. It's you and her/him fighting to solve the issue/conflict whatever it may be. The hardest part is identifying what the issue is and being honest about it.

More important than being honest is being kind through everything. You should really try to never hurt the person even if you are hurt/depressed yourself. If how you honestly feel about a person will hurt the person, often times it's best not say it and just leave the relationship. Of course explanation is in order if it's a very long term relationship but the truth is that some relationships just don't work out and there is nothing you nor her/him can do about it. It's probably either loss of physical attraction or loss of interest in spending time with the person or both.

**2. Don't avoid/ignore conflicts. Communicate everything.**

Mentioned above briefly but the goal of relationships in my eyes should be to grow and enjoy life together. That's it. Anything less than that is an issue. And sometimes you can't properly enjoy life due to some recurring issues, arguing or bad moods/looks. Talk it out. Speak your mind and show that it's you and her vs this problem. You want this to work out and you are open to everything unless it crosses your personal boundaries/values. Try and fix any issues that arise at their root.

Truly acknowledge and apologize for mistakes made. Don't be cruel. Treat your partner and everyone with respect.

**3. Be open to change but respect your own and your partner's personal boundaries.**

Everyone has some personal boundary. For some it could be cheating in whatever form (talking flirtatiously is already cheating to many). With respect to wanting to cheat, always respect your partner and discuss it but be ready to quit the relationship at this point as many are against any kind of [polyamory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory). It's better than doing something potentially hurtful behind someone's back and then being found out on it. The latter is [narcissistic behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/ustwo7/what_are_some_extremely_subtle_signs_you_missed/). Narcissistic behavior in general is very important to study. [Dr. Ramani](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/svuagm/i_strongly_advise_all_of_you_to_watch_dr_ramani/) is amazing resource on it as she has [many videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/DoctorRamani/videos) analyzing narcissistic behavior.

**4. Don't be narcissistic. Us, not just you.**

If you do make a mistake. Genuinely apologize and learn from it so as to not repeat it again. Never be cruel. And always treat your partner with respect. Speaking of narcissistic abuse, this [testimony by Johnny Depp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JTpvORujak) portraying alleged abuse of Amber Heard is a good read of how being with a narcissist can be catastrophic to your own self worth. It's best to detect narcissistic behavior early from either side of the relationship. Talk it out and try to fix it and become a better person not just for your partner but for yourself. I personally was narcissistic in many ways in my relationship. For example when I felt sad or depressed, I would ignore my partner and not listen to her because I 'have bigger problems' or I want to show my unhappiness to get comfort. This applied when I had depression ([from uni days, hated many of uni courses, being super poor and not believing in myself or my ability to actually earn money in this world](../education/university.md)), now I don't do this. Don't ignore the feelings and hurt of your partner.

If your partner wants comfort, show it. If your partner wants to talk, talk it out. Show love.

**5. Show love.**

Should actually be the first point as it is the most important thing in successful and happy relationships I think. Everyone should feel loved. What's the point of a relationship otherwise?

Showing love implies you actually genuinely love the other person. If you don't, just leave. Life is too short for this.

Showing love means trying your best to bring the other person up. Show happiness and gratitude for spending life together. Compliment her/him. Take walks. Go on dates, short and big. My favorite activity with my partner is to simply go for a walk and take a coffee together in some place outside. Discuss the day and your plans. You are a team after all.

I once thought flowers were useless but I learned with time. Flowers as an act of love is amazing in itself but also once you do buy flowers for your partner, you then put them in your home. This improves the atmosphere at home as flowers are lovely but it's also a subtle reminder to your partner that you are loved and cared for.

**6. Smell nice. Look after yourself.**

As relationship progresses, you can sometimes take your partner and love for granted. The more obvious example of such disregard is stopping putting effort into making yourself look great and looking after yourself in more broad terms. Solution here is not taking your partner for granted. And genuinely trying to be the best version of yourself at no cost of anyone. This applies for men especially but don't be afraid to share how you really feel with your partner. The worst thing you can do is suppressing your emotions out of fear of something. If you are in this position, remember the above, go from the position of love always. Be honest and communicate it all. Be kind and if something doesn't work out, first try to make it work. If nothing works out, move on. No such thing as lost time. There is only time well lived, your lessons, the ever present moment you are in and your thoughts of what the future holds. Nothing else matters as much. Your emotions are transitory. You are just an observer. Even to your own thoughts. It's what you act on that matters. And how it makes you feel.

**7. Be interested and fascinated by your partner genuinely. Be happier together.**

Direct consequence of being in love with a person is being genuinely fascinated by how your partner thinks and lives. And showing and sharing this fascination.

--

With respect to talking to new people and continuing and maintaining interest in conversation. Asking good questions is key. Being honest and humble in your replies to her/his questions. Be lighthearted and high spirited. You are happy to be here right now and talking about whatever the thing is. I met many people with whom I can really talk about anything and enjoy it. Listening to [various podcasts](../podcasts/podcasts.md) is amazing for practicing asking interesting questions and maintaining conversations.

I also share [my thoughts on finding romantic partners](seduction.md). One fun thing to do with your partner is to do a [fictional character test and guess who got who for a show](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1523104608973103104).

[The grass is greener where you water it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/qsdymo/the_grass_is_greener_where_you_water_it/). Say and show love to people you love. Sometimes, you have to know when to let go and quit.

- [I need kindness and thoughtfulness. I communicate it right away. I’m a fairly sensitive guy and don’t feel like that’s a negative quality so I need a partner that’s nice and who lets me know they’re thinking about me.

- [I need someone who gives the benefit of the doubt and assumes positive intent. Sometimes words or actions can be misinterpreted. Hopefully I have shown my partner that I am a good, caring person. So if something seems out of character, they should check in rather than assuming the worst. I do that in return by saying "Hey, when you said X it made me feel [mad/sad/rejected] because it sounds like [you're mad at me / frustrated / unsupported].

Now the climate is much different with the illusion of infinite choice and lack of investment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n2lwsh/how_much_of_dating_is_well_just_luck/)
- [One of the most useful changes I made to dating was to view early dates as a way to have fun and decide if I liked them, instead of worrying whether they liked me- they were going to feel whatever way they wanted to about me, and if I was being myself and they weren’t into that, I didn’t want them anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/n2x8ht/how_can_i_get_wooed_and_date_normally_as_a_people/)
- [Stop doing the things you do "for them" so much. Put all the effort you put into the chase into yourself. You want to call, call. You want to have a quiet day at home? Turn off your phone. You want to ask a guy out? Do it. Not sure if you're feeling it? Let him make the first move.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/n2x8ht/how_can_i_get_wooed_and_date_normally_as_a_people/)

If I want to double text I will, and the right person will be into it. I’m fully myself because it won’t scare off the right person. I’m communicative and ask for what I need. I think it all came down to being more comfortable being alone. I don’t have to change myself to make someone like me because if she doesn’t, I’m fine living my life with my friends.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n4jslg/people_who_had_a_much_better_dating_life_after_30/)
- [Having a romantic and sexual relationship is not a requirement for a happy life.

It's emotionally draining to take on that kind of responsibility.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27039498)
- [Match her energy. If you find yourself sending messages into the void, just stop. If they come back piecemeal after a long pause, then slow them down. If she's responding quickly and there's a lot of back and forth, then that's good too. Also, I would suggest you bring your excitement down just a bit. You don't want to seem like an eager beaver on the first date. Calm down a bit, be excited, but don't let your mind wander too much either. The last thing you want to look like is a starving man sitting in front of a buffet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n65tt8/after_3_months_of_zero_success_i_actually_have_an/)

- [Cheating happens for a few reasons, most being the person wants cake. Some are exit cheaters, where they are too cowardly to break up so they cheat until caught and are relieved because now they aren't the 'bad guy' who had to break it off. Some are seeking validation and have low self esteem so they want the ego boost knowing they are still desired. These people will also beg to reconcile. Some simply turn to others when they can't communicate or express feelings, and want their cake and to eat it too. Perhaps the relationship is in a funk and rather than just not being a selfish POS, they look outside the relationship if the grass is greener. These people will also beg to reconcile because they can't make up their mind. No matter the reason, cheating hurts the other person. And its cowardly and selfish. Not to mention STI's and the trauma from being lied to, gaslit and manipulated. Cheaters lie. Thats what they do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n5lbu9/new_partner_told_me_theyve_cheated_in_the_past/)

- [Emotional maturity is empathy and accountability, or how people conduct themselves in a disagreement/confrontation. Everyone's just fine when things are peachy, it's the lows that bring things out. People who are instantly defensive, deflect etc. are insufferable. If you can put yourself in their shoes, actually look within and take responsibility for your part, that's pretty freaking hot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n6kj1j/what_are_are_some_key_signs_of_emotional_maturity/)
- [Emotional maturity to me is proactively treating people in a way you'd want to be treated and doing the hard thing over the easy thing in life. I think something like ending a relationship or being honest about where you're at [like seeing someone new so you want to focus your energy there] over ghosting someone is doing the hard thing over the easy thing. Approaching people proactively to solve problems in good faith vs avoiding them because you're scared of conflict is the hard thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n6kj1j/what_are_are_some_key_signs_of_emotional_maturity/)

- [Coffee and walk are often the best dates.

- [I think compassion is the best way to defuse anger. Have lots of compassion towards yourself for feeling hurt and rejected. You went into this hoping to find love but it didn’t work out. That hurts. Also try having some compassion towards your ex to, she also tried to find love with you but it didn’t work. Or maybe have compassion towards her for making mistakes and getting it wrong. It doesn’t mean you have to condone how she behaved. If you can’t manage compassion you could start with feeling sorry for her. Try not to see it in such black and white terms as her being a monster and you being a blameless victim. That won’t help you in the long run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nbbdcz/how_do_you_let_go_of_anger_toward_someone_who/)

- [In toxic relationships, you're forced to choose between honesty and loyalty. You bite your tongue to protect their ego. In healthy relationships, honesty is an expression of loyalty. You speak your mind to help them grow. When you have real trust and respect, candor shows care.](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1489614193988968448)

- [The backwards thing about “networking” in your early years is that it feels like you should connect w/ high profile, successful people. In reality, those people are so checked out & won’t be able to do anything for you. Instead, spend your time talking to new, undiscovered folks.](https://twitter.com/nikitabier/status/1501578192355692544)

- [Открытые отношения полиамория квир-отношения как бы это не назвалось главное что это не про желание спать со всеми подряд а про стремление выстроить с одним человеком или группой людей доверительную связь которая в идеале может длиться до конца жизни. Это долгий трудный процесс.](https://twitter.com/ilyaviache/status/1521025311101566976)
- [Opening up a relationship for another specific person to be included is widely regarded as a red flag/bad idea in the poly community. It can work out, but it very rarely does, especially if one partner isn't full sold on it. Typically, the more ideal way to open from a monogamous one to a poly one includes a long time of self reflection and growth on both accounts, completely open conversations with one another, and asking and finding the answers to a million different questions... and then continuing to do all of that after you have opened to other relationships. Being poly is as much about being together and it is about being alone, and everyone respecting each other's needs and wants collectively. It's difficult to do if you aren't on board with it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ugaq8u/wife_wants_to_be_polyamorous/)

- [Falling in love with a woman is the easiest damned thing in the world. You’re genetically driven to do this. Liking a woman is a lot harder; you don’t usually have as much in common with her (down to societal/genetic differences) as you do with your boys. I’ve been with the same woman for 2 decades and when asked what the key to success in our relationship is it’s always the same: it’s more important that you like your spouse than that you love them! When you have to spend the vast majority of your time with someone not dancing the horizontal mambo then you’d better make damned sure that you like them and can talk to them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ukb9m0/what_is_something_you_know_about_women_all_young/)
- [Don't take dating advice from women. What women say they want in a man is vastly different from what they react positively to. Get dating advice from men who attract women, and use judgment and trial and error to see what works best. Grain of salt, and all that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ukb9m0/what_is_something_you_know_about_women_all_young/)
- [Inara Serra](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/FS/3/) & [Jamie Fraser](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/OL/2/) have nice character traits.
- [I like the freedom polyamory gives me. I like meeting new and interesting people in both a platonic and romantic way and I don't want to be told I'm not allowed. I think it also increases trust and attraction in a relationship. Sounds counter-intuitive, but monogamy does not solve the problem of jealousy. People in monogamous relationships still experience jealousy and trust issues. I'm sure you have experienced this. If you are non-monogamous you are less likely to think that your partner is going to leave you for someone else, because why would they need to? They are allowed to sleep with other people without crossing any boundaries or having to break off their relationship with you first. There are different types of enm and at the moment I have one serious partner and only date others casually. I feel so much more comfortable and connected with my partner knowing that we both have the freedom to do what we like.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/umz7wz/for_those_who_practice_ethical_nonmonogamy_why_do/)

- [I think maybe one part of breakups people underestimate is how people in love develop their own sort of language and a rich shared world of characters and motifs. & then when the relationship ends there’s a special loneliness in realizing you’ll never speak that language again.](https://twitter.com/jzux/status/1526346570127532039)
