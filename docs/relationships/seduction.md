# Seduction

Have a [long term partner](relationships.md) I love now but at some point I was reading a bit about seduction and was interested in it. One of the books that really changed how I thought about meeting women and anyone else really is [Models](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633800-models). The basic gist is that honesty is everything. Be honest with your intentions and where you want things to progress. Focus on yourself above all. Everything is an experience. Never focus on results but the process of it. That means not fearing having your ego hurt by [rejections](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12hv1p5/how_to_carry_self_around_someone_whos_rejected_you/jfr2yye/?context=3). There is nothing that can impact how you feel but yourself.

It also taught me about importance of independence in all aspects. Your feelings and self worth should never be defined by anyone but you. It is hard/impossible to be your true self if you are trying to impress anyone for fear of losing them. If the relationship or first encounter doesn't work out, don't dwell on it and move on.

Being honest with your intentions together with awareness that the worst cases that can happen will often have no affect on your life at the end of the day brings confidence. Confidence in knowing that everything is a learning opportunity and that life is a matter of [maximizing future positive outcomes](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1367871165319049221). Confidence in knowing your value, what you like and not being afraid to express yourself goes a long way.

People like you for [how you make them feel](https://www.compass-usa.com/how-you-made-them-feel/). Compliments are great, just don't over do it and always be genuine. One thing I love doing when I meet new people is asking [what they are excited about](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1507219196781871113). And listening well. [Proust Questionnaire](https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2000/01/proust-questionnaire) has some great questions for purposes of getting to know another person well. I memorized the questions with [Anki](../anki/anki.md) just to have it on top of my mind for getting the conversation going. Important to not make conversations be like interviews, just show you enjoy the company of another person and are genuinely excited of getting to know them. Play off what they say and be playful/funny. I like the idea of [warm approaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/zea18m/turning_cold_approaches_into_warm_approaches/) as a way to make sure interaction is most likely to go well for both.

One thing that's often effective in getting to know a person is [making playful assumptions about the person](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12bi0we/comment/jf11lt9/?context=3).

If things are progressing nicely in conversation and you do have genuine romantic interest for the person, you can show your interest subtly. [Through actions. Not words.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yo8w7s/im_a_24_year_old_virgin_girls_are_attracted_to_me/ivfeigw/) If you see the interest is not mutual, [cut your losses early and stop romantic pursuits for the person](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/yolc53/the_brutal_selection_process_that_all_men_have_to/). Don't get fixated on any single person despite how you feel about them in the moment. Emotions are powerful thing and only time and [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) solves it. So give it time and still connect with any person you find interesting.

That is the mental side of this at least. If you have this covered and [look and feel great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eamhOiWmUro) (look after yourself by [eating well](../health/nutrition/nutrition.md) (whole foods, no sugar), [exercising](fitness/fitness.md), look after your [skin](../health/skin-care.md)). There are more practical things you can do to get better. The most important thing is making new approaches (respectful and understanding of the setting) and learning from each experience. And that doesn't mean flirting with everyone. It's simply getting to know everyone and showing your interest if there is one.

Nowadays most everyone meets online. This makes cold approaches such as approaching a man/woman on the street to say you find them interesting/cute more effective as most/everyone will be surprised and most often pleasantly so unless they are very busy or in some bad mood and thus will be annoyed. And in such worst case, they will let you know this quickly so cut the communication and apologize if need be.

Of course the best time to approach and meet anyone is in some appropriate setting like an event or some party. Again this doesn't mean meeting just for the purpose of flirting. I talk to everyone because I am genuinely fascinated by most every human I meet and read about. So I always love meeting and talking in person. For cases of flirting, the main things to focus on are (in my opinion):

1. Be confident and interesting above all.
2. Be calm and not rushy in the way you talk and move.
3. Don't be afraid to hold eye contact for longer times.
4. Focus on making the girl feel a positive emotional connection. Usually through being funny and lighthearted in how you talk.
5. Be more clear with your intentions, indirectly works best (show you are interested/into the person without saying it).

This applies to both in person and messaging (above but minus the eye contact part and plus for use of fancy animated stickers on [Telegram](../tools/telegram.md) to express yourself more).

As for date ideas and how to get dates online. Dating apps like Tinder/Bumble can bring [mixed results](https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1087575749949673472) and the focus there is to have a list of [great photos above all](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12af60p/comment/jesekel/?context=1) with some short interesting bio. [Busy cities work best](https://twitter.com/proetrie/status/1647652242676228099) for online dating apps.

For chatting, above mentioned advice applies but the goal with online dating is to meet in person as soon as possible if there is a connection and you like the person. You will know more from a brief or if lucky longer period of time you are on a date getting [coffee or taking a walk](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nc9k7o/first_date_ideas/) then messaging online for days. As you both swiped on each other, the other person is already interested unless they just seek validation and want some compliments sent their way (supposedly lots do really just want this). Some may find it too forward to meet soon for fear of safety but the advice of proposing to meet IRL sooner applies only if you do it when both will feel right when you propose this. I often wrote [`Let's get a drink sometime. Would love to know more about you.`](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12gatev/comment/jfjjbw4/?context=3) or some variation of it. Also moving the conversation to a more real chat app like Telegram is also best done as soon as possible if there is some mutual interest often as a result of a good date/meet.

Having said all of above, I think the most effective approach is having a great aesthetic Instagram and doing cold approaches. There is too much flakiness involved with online dating.

[seduction subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/) is actually a great community with advice that generalizes to outside of finding a nice partner. Also liked [this discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZS2CczndCI) going over the current state of dating.

[Relationships](relationships.md) of any kind especially ones that are romantic are truly fascinating to learn to get better at. I shared things I've learned about having more happy relationships [in my wiki here](relationships.md). In summary it's:

1. Be honest. Be kind. Be empathetic.
2. Don't avoid/ignore conflicts. Communicate everything.
3. Be open to change but respect your own and your partner's personal boundaries.
4. Don't be narcissistic. Us, not just you.
5. Show love.
6. Smell nice. Look after yourself.
7. Be interested and fascinated by your partner genuinely. Be happier together.

## Notes

- [Play to win, not to lose. That is focus on the wins, disregard/learn from the losses. Commit to it. Let go and do it for yourself above all. Don't focus on results, focus on having fun. Set your goals and enjoy the process. Fully let go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WHNU520SvU)
- It is better to exchange Instagram accounts with girls you've approached than trying to share phone numbers.
- The best dates you can go to are ones where you can easily share a conversation together.
- [“Nice” is subjective. Typically, the guys who consider themselves the “nice guy” are the ones who do what they think is nice with an added contingency, as if buying a meal or being a normal human being means they deserve affection and adoration from a girl. Nice guys don’t finish last, disingenuous guys do. The douche bags get girls because they do what they want, not what they think the girl wants. Moral of the story: be genuine and be your own human being, not what you think people want or expect you to be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99uixo/nice_guys_finish_last/)
- [Enjoy yourself while talking, don’t make it your goal to please her, but to enjoy yourself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99yal5/guys_any_tips_on_how_to_flirt_with_a_girl/)
- [Some women will spend hours getting ready before they go out. If you compliment their style and how they've put themselves together it validates all of that work and goes a lot further than just saying some variation of "you're beautiful".](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99yal5/guys_any_tips_on_how_to_flirt_with_a_girl/)
- [Consuming information but NOT approaching women?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqDFncK-hJE)
- [It’s hard because you have to get comfortable with being vulnerable. You have to be open to the chance of getting hurt. Be okay with putting your all out there and getting nothing in return. You have to love who you really are enough to know that regardless of whether the person you’re trying to open up to accepts you or not, you’re still the same complete you either way.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/9wv6v5/how_modern_dating_feels/e9nlnmt/)
- [Strong eye-contact, slow movements and masculine body language.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
  - What this guy means by masculine body language is essentially leading and taking control physically. Touch her arms, hold her hands and lightly rub them with your thumbs, twiddle around with her fingers. This works incredibly well if you’re sitting across a table from her. If you’re beside her like at a bar, keep her in your frame. Turn your legs toward her so that if she were to move forward she’d be between them. Again touching her arms, don’t be aggressive! Move closer to her, whisper in her ear. Hold her close, have your arm around her. Those have worked really well in my experience. That’s just a few of many possible ways to show her “hey, I like you more than someone who just wants to be your friend.”
- Once your body starts to act masculine, your mind will soon soon follow.
- [Masculine body language - Take up space, don't slouch, don't sit like a chick with your knees together. Don't twitch, be non-reactive. Imagine a lion: he doesn't give a shit about what's going on around him. He's always relaxed with his head up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
- [The difference between creepy or not, is how attractive you are (which is determined by everything else you're doing).](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
  - Just be unflinching during conversation. General rule of thumb for any interaction is to look at their eyes long enough to realise their eye colour (bit longer if your flirting), look away, then back again rinse and repeat. Another tactic for flirting, is using the triangle: left eye, right eye, lips, repeat. Looking at their lips implies you want to kiss them. Use that when you have more rapport.
  - One exercise you can use: If you spot a girl you like, look at her. If she looks your way, make brief eye contact, look away for a moment, then back again. If she's still looking at you, its a good chance she wants you to talk to her. Girls are pretty persistent in getting attention from guys they like.
  - If she's not looking, its a good chance she's not interested. Don't stare at her. Move on.
- Eye-contact is fundamental. When you look a woman in the eye, don't hide the fact that you want her. Maintain eye-contact. This is a very clear signal you are interested in a woman sexually.
  - Just for clarity. When you make eye contact you need to choose an eye. You can't oscillate back and forth between them. And when he says "maintain eye contact" it doesn't mean blankly stare into her eyes uninterrupted. It means when you do look at her, look into her eyes. Not just at her face. And hold that eye contact slightly longer than you would regularly with other people.
- [I think advanced game is loving yourself no matter what happens to you. Rejections, shit tests, break-ups, critics, emotions. These are all opportunities to learn, to improve, to love yourself more, to be authentic, to go forward. It's not about protecting yourself so you don't feel anything anymore, it's about being at peace with what goes inside of you and outside of you. It's about breaking down your limiting beliefs and your expectations, going with the flow and being in the moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/elut4g/advanced_game_is_just_not_giving_a_fuck/)
- [Stop chasing girls and focus entirely on self development](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/n057n9/female_perspective_on_online_dating/)
- [In person approaching > online dating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/n057n9/female_perspective_on_online_dating/)
- [Women will respect your courage. It’s never creepy if you stay respectful. You can’t get in trouble for talking to strangers. She can’t do nothing about if your not harassing her. Some guys think talking to women they don’t know is like against the law.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/myz64b/women_will_respect_your_courage/)
- [The only way to know if she finds you attractive is to approach her.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/myz64b/women_will_respect_your_courage/)
- [I really like "I really want to kiss you right now." If they are into it too, they can explicitly give permission ("well then you should!" or something along those lines, or they could just initiate the kiss), and if they're not feeling the same they can just laugh or something to change the subject. It changes the dynamic from "tell me yes or no" to "tell me yes or I'll assume no" and I think there's a real benefit to that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- [Every woman is different so I am sure you will get other answers too but for me personally I don’t like compliments about my looks too early on - “you look great, I love your dress/shoes/etc” is ok but the “you are so beautiful” compliments too early on always make me a bit uneasy. Compliments about my personality always go down better. I would also encourage you not to worry about “flirting” too much - I would much rather talk to a guy who was genuinely interested in getting to know me and my interests than a charming guy who is good at flirting, you know? There’s nothing wrong with talking to a woman the way you would talk to a friend - especially at the beginning - you are just getting to know each other and finding out if you connect on a deeper level. Keep calm and try to remember not too much too quickly and it will all fall into place. Good luck, I hope you meet some great people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- [Compliment people on things they choose. So clothes/hair/accessories are fine for a quick compliment on appearance. Then talk about other stuff that they also choose: interests, hobbies, opinions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- Show genuine interest.
- [You don't need permission to think or feel sexually about someone. It's how you treat them that matters. As far as flirting with people, you will make mistakes and you will make people uncomfortable from time to time, we all do. Just like with other kinds of interaction. If it happens, just apologize and carry on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- [How would you talk to a potential friend? Speak to this person the same way. Conversation flows or it doesn’t. Presenting with a list of questions quickly turns a date into an interview. Be yourself, allow silences if they occur and let your activities or what she says guide the conversation. Also don’t forget you’re also picking someone here which lowers the pressure of “I hope they like me.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n406f4/i_30m_am_going_on_my_first_inperson_date_in_over/)
- [I absolutely stopped giving a good goddamn what people thought of me. Apathy apparently comes across as confidence.

- [Make a habit of talking to all strangers, not just attractive women. Seduction is a subset of being generally charismatic with people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mvehzo/make_a_habit_of_talking_to_all_strangers_not_just/)

- [Women generally already put a lot of effort into meeting a guy. Hell, a lot of times they put this effort in every single day because it’s what society expects! They’re usually shaving their legs and pits, putting on makeup, doing their hair, how can you, as a guy, not think it’s worth taking the effort, too? That may mean a manicure, but that also might just mean a nice set of clothes for pics and dating, trimming that beard neatly, and working on conversation. But putting in nowhere near the effort most women put in seems to be one of the biggest areas many men lack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mph90l/speaking_as_a_woman_dont_forget_youre_always/)
- [Start with the basics: gym, style, haircut, grooming, smell good/be clean. The big mistake I see guys make is not taking charge of the interaction after a compliment. They sit there and go “you’re beautiful “, yeah, ok, now what asshole? Tell her what you want. Just also show you could take or leave it, because being direct+not needy=bold and being direct+needy=creepy](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mph90l/speaking_as_a_woman_dont_forget_youre_always/)
- [Girls like to get to know a person first, so like. Before relationship stage is like a "good kinda flirtatious friend stage". I personally learnt that the "good kinda flirtatious friend stage" is the line I need to hit. Naturals and charismatic guys know this line instinctively. And the line varies from type of girl to girl. (Ex, sterotypical bookworms and super popular girls have different lines). Anyways. Don't over flirt, don't never flirt, don't try not being a friend too, and be good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mv413g/pro_tip_i_learned_from_a_natural/)
- [Conflict drives tension, tension drives interest/desire, and desire leads to seduction. Showing some disagreement is a great way to start flirting.

- [Flirty energy comes out of a deep comfort. It is like this acceptance of who you are and a confidence that the other person will like and receive you. Being flirty is playful. It is fun and without expectation. Flirting doesn’t have a goal. Somehow fake it till you make it, believe in your value and believe that the men you are with will value and be attracted to you. Lose expectations. React playfully in the moment. Don’t be concerned with outcome or keeping up appearances.

- [Generally women are quite direct they'll come up and flirt with you as well if they're interested. They'll also be more inclined to clarity in my opinion; do you want a specific type of relationship like fwb or you want to date more serious that's mostly information you should share at an appropriate time (once you get a sense of the connection of course). Also most women I know would not care for dating "rules" such as waiting three days to call or waiting to reply. No need for games, just say where you're at and the mature ones will do the same! Some basic chivalry is always welcome. A lot of people meet while out in bars/clubs/social clubs etc. and about although a lot of people also use dating apps. A few diverse pics and a short bio that doesn't seem too over constructed is always good. Happen, breeze, tinder, bumble. As a first date drinks is pretty normal but you can always think of something special.

When you touch her or flirt with her you are letting her know you feel that way about her. Of course, you do that with the expectation that she can say "No". To put it into words, it's like you're telling her: "Hey. I feel attracted to you. I wanted to let you know, so you can decide if you feel the same and want to do something about it."](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/129vxup/men_who_used_to_always_be_seen_only_as_a_friend/)

It’s SIGNIFICANTLY more effective than the “You’re cute I wanted to talk to you” even though that also works if you are completely out of ideas. As long as you have the right attitude and mindset when you approach. That’s how I personally do it. If you also wanna turbocharge that, qualify after the opener.

And than I'd ask "Well you seem pretty chill can I grab your number quick." And hopefully she says "Sure". The key is is to not overthink it and go with the situation. If you feel the vibe off of her like your doing something wrong than you probably are. Trust your social intuition. If you see that someone's crying or someones really busy or in a hurry than it's probably best to not approach that person. Try to find someone that looks approachable and won't be bothered by you talking to them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12bi0we/best_cold_approach_openers/)
- [Too many questions. Am I the only one who feels like it sounds like an interview? From reading Mark Manson’s book Models, I’ve come to learn that you should probably make assumptions most of the time when you’re chatting with women instead of asking questions. He calls it cold reading. For example, instead of asking “who are you going to see?”, you could be like “I have a feeling you are the rock type of person. The typical crazy makeup, yelling at the top of their lungs kinda rock fan”. Personally, it works for me. You’ll get it wrong and they will correct you - this means that they will just answer the question that you based your cold read on. You get it wrong and the other person is intrigued and wants to know why you thought that. You might get lucky and guess completely right and this will build an instant rapport with the other person. Whatever happens it’s a much more interesting way to get the other person talking and alot more effective than asking endless questions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12bi0we/best_cold_approach_openers/)
- [You need experience man you need to throw yourself in the fire and come back alive then pick your self a part and then go back again until you A have a type of women you like, B know what type of women you attract this is two different things. Go out with a goal to find 3 women you can progress with and move toward dating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12cu8rm/where_do_i_meet_girls/)
- [Building lasting connections is something a lot of people struggle with. There is no mathematical formula because humans are largely unpredictable. Most people look back on the thousands of faces they have met and count their real friends on one hand. There are some "tactics" you can use. Smile, eye contact, deeper conversation, "kino," etc but if you want to make a lasting impression a lot of it comes down to timing, setting, mood, and other factors outside of your control. This is when you just have to go out and experience it, because your mind picks up more by doing than you could ever read online. Especially with women. One day they're talkative and enthusiastic, the next time they've gone cold, then they're horny, then they're getting cold again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12d5758/getting_dates_is_easy_having_good_ones_is_hard/)
- [Find out what they like and talk about that. What activities are you doing? If it is a game make it a bit competitive and banter. Banter is a big part of it as it makes the atmosphere casual and fun.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12d5758/getting_dates_is_easy_having_good_ones_is_hard/)
- [Many girls don't want to discuss values or hear you blather on about your life or hobbies at a bar. Imagine that she didn't speak English. What would you do? Naturally you would steer the date toward a physical activity that doesn't require much talking... dancing, kissing, and eventually sex. Take action. Assumes bar/club environment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12d5758/getting_dates_is_easy_having_good_ones_is_hard/)
- [1: Focus on having fun above everything else. Like you would with your best friend or buddy. This includes teasing, joking around, etc. She has to see you've got personality and aren't some basement-dwelling, clueless troll. It also shows you’re not intimidated by her if she’s hot and aren’t afraid to ruffle her feathers because you’re not desperate to please. 2: At the start of the date, just talk about normal subjects. Stuff that interests you, that you find fascinating, even random small talk subjects. Ask her similar questions about stuff that interests her, etc. She must see that you're a regular, non-weird, non-creepy dude. This will put her at ease when she see's you're not some idiot/maniac/weirdo. At some point, the conversations get deeper and deeper, which lets you connect on a personal/emotional level. Where you both talk about your passions, values, etc. 3: You must be physical THROUGHOUT the entire date. Little by little, at appropriate moments, constantly ramping it up. Otherwise, if you don't touch her throughout the whole date, she will freak out when you finally make your move and go in for intimacy/makeout/etc. She MUST become comfortable with you and your touch, with your closeness to her, etc. 4: After you see she enjoys your company and likes you at least somewhat, YOU MUST CREATE SEXUAL TENSION. And then maintain it throughout the entire date moving forward. This is the thing that gets you laid the very same day. This is how you avoid the friendzone. Creating sexual tension is a massive topic in and of itself. But it's all about powerful eye contact, voice tonality, body language, eventually touching her on places where "mere friends" or acquaintances never would, taking the conversation onto more intimate/sexual topics, etc. DO NOT MAKE OUT WITH HER ON THE DATE IF YOU WANT A SAME DAY LAY as that will dissipate the sexual tension. Instead, tease her with almost-kisses, etc. to ramp up the sexual tension. I pretty much never kiss a girl before sleeping with her on the same day (really counter-intuitive, I know). But yeah, if you’re after something more serious or want to take things slow, disregard this. 5: Finally, logistics. If you're really masterful at creating sexual tension after she decides you're a fun-normal-awesome dude, then you can even take her by the hand and lead her to the venue's bathroom if your date was at a bar/cafe/restaurant/club, but that's the exception to the rule as not many will be able to get women really horny. Otherwise, invite her over to your house for whatever you can think of that sounds innocent enough to warrant a visit. For example, I hype up my travels during the date, and say I really wanna show her some awesome videos from my trips abroad.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12d5758/getting_dates_is_easy_having_good_ones_is_hard/)
- [For building sexual tension: If you are having a good date and she is receptive, offer her something then take it away.. say lean in to kiss her, tease it, stop and then continue talking about whatever random shit you where talking about. Build up slow, flirt, sense her genuine curiosity into you, then give her something erotic and then take it away.. build up.. release.. build up.. release. It works the same in bed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12d5758/getting_dates_is_easy_having_good_ones_is_hard/)
- [For Tinder/Bumble/ profiles: 1. Have high resolution photos. Don’t post photos that are blurry, dark, or at a strange angle. 2. Have a friend who is good at photography or hire someone to take some photos of you where you look attractive, but also natural. You need a couple of photos where you look ‘hot’—well dressed, well groomed, essentially the most attractive version of you. I wouldn’t have these type of photos comprise your entire profile, but definitely include a few. The person who is experienced with photos can instruct you on poses/angles. It is absolutely a wise investment if you pay a few hundred. 3. If you have a picture of yourself at formal event or wedding, especially a candid where you’re laughing, dancing, or having a good time. It conveys status, being social. 4. Include a ‘polarizing’ picture. Pictures from Halloween or costume parties are S tier. You essentially want to convey that you’re fun, self-amused, and don’t give a fuck what others think. 5. A bonus if you have a picture with a dog or animal. Don’t get a dog for the sake of impressing women obviously, but a (good, high resolution) picture with a dog is a great conversation starter. 6. Avoid selfies. Selfies indicate that you are alone and low status. If you must include a selfie, try to make it at an interesting location. Also, women want to see a photo that is a full representation of how you look, including your body. Selfies do a poor job of this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/12af60p/comment/jesekel/?context=1)
