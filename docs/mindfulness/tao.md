## Notes

- [I’m pretty new to Taoism, but from what I understand so far, concepts like morality and ethics arise when we’re not in sync with the Tao... and if we can let go of those concepts, or at least not hold so tightly on to them, along with other desires and misconceptions humans will return to their natural state from which love and respect naturally flow. So when we let go of the concept of morality things line up inside of us on their own, but when we try to grasp it it slips through our fingers, because we’ve taken what can’t be explained and confined it to logic and words, which will always be incomplete, and so misguiding.](https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/9rgqka/what_is_the_daoist_conceptionunderstanding_of/)
- [The purpose of a flower is to bloom, the purpose of the wind is to blow, the purpose of a duck is to swim and fly and quack, and the purpose of you is to do whatever it is that you are doing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/9qnmt2/what_is_the_point_of_being_here_of_being_alive/)
  - If you're looking for an end goal you're missing the point. This whole wondrous, fantastically intricate goings-on that you're experiencing and taking part in right in this moment is itself the whole point to being alive.
