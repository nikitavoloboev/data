# Nix on macOS

There is [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) project that brings Nix configuration to describing many of macOS services.

## Notes

- To not enter password on every `darwin-rebuild switch` with [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin), you can create `/etc/sudoers.d/nix-darwin` file with this content:
  - `<home-user> ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /run/current-system/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild` (where `home-user` is name of home directory)
- Nix darwin generates files to `etc/static`
