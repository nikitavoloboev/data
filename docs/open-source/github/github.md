# [GitHub](https://github.com)

I ♥️️ GitHub. It is one of the best communities out there that exists with so many different projects and ideas being worked on at any given time.

I publish most of my work and make it open source for other people to use and reuse.

[Here](../../sharing/my-github.md) you can find all the repositories I shared.

[GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is useful. One thing I want to do is meet top GitHub contributors from different countries and talk with them. [Git Stars](https://git-stars.com/users) provides a neat tool for that. I use [Go GitHub](https://github.com/google/go-github) lib to access GitHub data.

I like to [make private contributions private on my profile](https://i.imgur.com/a6YOHKI.png) (in [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/profile)) as it makes the squares on the GitHub timeline view nicer to use. Wish others did it too.

[gh-poi](https://github.com/seachicken/gh-poi) is useful for cleaning up already merged git branches.

## Notes

- Can append `#readme` to GitHub repo URL to jump to README of the repo.
- Selecting some text in a GitHub comment and pressing `r` will make a reply of that text.
- [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump) workflow is one of the best things you can install to navigate GitHub like a God.
  - I [slightly modified it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows#workflow-augmentations) to jump to different parts of the repo with modifiers like going to issues, releases, opening new issue or even cloning the repo instantly.
- I can include media files like GIFs in the repository itself and then just reference them from readme to embed them.
- I can include and mix in HTML in GitHub readme's. This is super useful for embedding images because you can customize `width` and `height` values to make the READMEs look a lot nice.
- I can tack in various GitHub related templates like `issue_template.md` and `pull_request_template.md` as well as `code_of_conduct.md` and even `contributing.md` under `.github` folder at the root of my project.

- [Describe what your function should do in a comment before you implement the function & GitHubCopilot might just write the damn thing for you.](https://twitter.com/erikras/status/1460562819452129284)
