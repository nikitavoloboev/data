# Everything I know

Page of things I consider myself knowledgeable of. Similar in spirit to [Dan's post on things he doesn't know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/).

- [Karabiner](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md): I bind all most common actions I do on my mac via Karabiner and my custom modifier keys ([`a` key is control, `w` opens apps, ..](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md#my-personal-karabiner-setup)).
- [macOS](../macOS/macOS.md): How to operate it very fast. Especially with apps like [KM](../macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro.md), [Alfred](../macOS/apps/alfred/alfred.md), [VSCode](../text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md).
- [Solid](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md): Using it for all my web apps and static sites. Love how it takes all the best parts of [React](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/react/react.md) (component tree model with one way data flow & JSX) but does it better due to [fine grained reactivity ](https://dev.to/ryansolid/a-hands-on-introduction-to-fine-grained-reactivity-3ndf) & avoiding VDOM thus being [much faster than React](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1528479450828087299). I try to be conscious of [performance](../web/web-performance.md) in all my projects.
- [Go](../programming-languages/go/go.md): Prefer using Go for all code I want to run not in the browser (scripts, web services, servers of all kinds) due to it's fast compile speeds & performance.
- [EdgeDB](../databases/edgedb.md) - My DB of choice for all projects. Sits on top of [Postgres](../databases/postgresql.md) but has [insanely well made query language](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/index) & [declarative schema modeling](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/datamodel/index) that is a breeze to edit. Nearly all queries are easy to construct & are super fast without doing any optimizations.
- [SQLite](../databases/sqlite.md): Use it for whenever I need an embedded database. Local apps etc. Exploring local first architectures like [Replicache](https://replicache.dev/) & [Logux](https://logux.io/).
- [Cloudflare Workers](../cloud-computing/serverless-computing/cloudflare-workers.md) & [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/): Looking into using it as distributed cache & small data store. [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) seem like a nice library for workers. Cloudflare in general has great web services I like using.
- [Swift](../programming-languages/swift/swift.md) & [SwiftUI](../programming-languages/swift/swift-libraries/swiftui.md): Build all native apps with them.
- [TS](../programming-languages/typescript/typescript.md) & [Deno](../web/deno.md): Use TS in all my web apps. Also exploring Deno for writing small scripts/automations.

## My Workflow

I list all the [tools](../tools/tools.md) and my [approaches to life](../focusing/rules.md) & [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) in [here](my-workflow.md). It's constantly updating. I try to automate all the annoying things I encounter.

## Learning now

What I'm learning now can be found in [Notion Goals board](https://www.notion.so/e462537d8f3d40c095ea67091ca91f45?v=1006717e984a4243b198bcad5bf05198).

Choosing what to learn is ideally due to making some [idea](ideas/ideas.md) I am excited about come alive.

Or I am curious about something and want to explore. Lately it's been:

- [Solid](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) / [Cloudflare Workers](../cloud-computing/serverless-computing/cloudflare-workers.md) / [EdgeDB](../databases/edgedb.md)
- [Swift](../programming-languages/swift/swift.md) / [SwiftUI](../programming-languages/swift/swift-libraries/swiftui.md)
- [Type Theory](../math/type-theory/type-theory.md)
- [Physics](../physics/physics.md)
