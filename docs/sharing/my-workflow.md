# My Workflow

One of my bigger passions in life is being able to do more with less. [Life is short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html) and I want to [maximize the fun outcomes in life](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1367871165319049221).

In spirit of maximizing outcomes, I want more amazing, kind and happy humans all around the globe and I want to do my part in making a dent on the world. My workflow below is what makes me move faster in life, I hope it helps/inspires you too in some way. ♥️

Or [Go](../programming-languages/go/go.md)/[Rust](../programming-languages/rust/rust.md) packaged as [Docker container](../operating-systems/containers/docker.md) with [Nix](../package-managers/nix/nix.md). Deployed on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) or [Fly.io](../cloud-computing/fly-io.md) or own hardware with [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/).
-  CLI/scripts - [TS](../programming-languages/typescript/typescript.md) ran with [Bun](../programming-languages/javascript/bun.md). Or [Go](../programming-languages/go/go.md)/[Rust](../programming-languages/rust/rust.md).

## Project tools

- [GitHub](../open-source/github/github.md) - Code sharing & collaboration. Issues & Roadmaps for OSS projects. Want [Height](https://height.app/)/[Linear](https://linear.app/) level desktop client for GitHub. Like [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html).
- [Height](https://height.app/) - All internal projects. [Also have `Personal` board](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1586439817516429312) to realign ideas I work on with my big focuses for the month.
- [Notion](../tools/notion.md) - Everything wiki, collaboration. Team Docs.
- [Discord](../tools/discord.md) or [Telegram](../tools/telegram.md) - According to type & size of project. Small community/project, Telegram group is great. Open source or community project, Discord. More corporate, maybe Slack. But it's super expensive & unusable for open communities.

- For serving websites, [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) are great. Also looking into [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) as my API is on Cloudflare Workers already.
- [AWS](../cloud-computing/aws/aws.md)/[GCP](../cloud-computing/gcp/gcp.md) have some niche useful services I use too.

## Utility

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - Quick sketches, thinking things through.

## Solid

- State - [createSignal](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api) & [Nano Store](https://github.com/nanostores/solid).
- Queries - [Solid Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/adapters/solid-query)

## Web

- Performance check - use [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/)

## Design System

- Components - [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/), [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/), [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/)

## Payment

- [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/) for [cheaper fees](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34609182). [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout) has nice DX though.

## Analytics

## Git

- [Sublime Merge](https://simgenie.app/) - Visual Git interface. Nice way to see changes + past commits.
- [gitupdate](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/gitupdate) - Automate commits. Use it for all doc, curated list updates and as commits inside feature branches (branch gets squashed after with proper commit).

## Other

- Forms: Write in code. [Reform](https://www.reform.app/) seems nice too.
