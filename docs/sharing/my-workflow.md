# My Workflow

One of my bigger passions in life is being able to do more with less. [Life is short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html) and I want to [maximize the fun outcomes in life](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1367871165319049221).

In spirit of maximizing outcomes, I want more amazing, kind and happy humans all around the globe and I want to do my part in making a dent on the world. My workflow below is what makes me move faster in life, I hope it helps/inspires you too in some way. ♥️

- [Discord](../tools/discord.md) or [Telegram](../tools/telegram.md) - According to type & size of project. Small community/project, Telegram group is great. Open source or community project, Discord. More corporate, maybe Slack. But it's super expensive & unusable for open communities.

## Git
