[Mycelium](https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/mycelium/) is fascinating.

## Notes

- [We think of mushrooms as being "the fungus" but really a mushroom is just a temporary structure that the fungus, which a network of hyphae buried in the substrate, builds to disperse its spores. They're like a protrusion from an unseen world into ours.](https://twitter.com/NotBrunoAgain/status/1520055622997270534)
