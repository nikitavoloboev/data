# Management

[Linear](https://linear.app/) & [Height](https://height.app/) are nice project management tools. I use GitHub issues for all my project management tasks. Want to build a nice desktop client app for GitHub similar to [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html).

[Basecamp Employee Handbook](https://basecamp.com/handbook) has nice ideas.

## Notes

- [At Shopify, we tend to do whatever our engineers want in this regard. My team meets weekly and looks at a kanban project board. If we need to adjust, we have retros, etc and change the process. We have the autonomy. IMO while you need some consistency to get alignment on goals at a high level and coarse quarter-level goals, at the team level you can more or less let the team decide and then judge them on their effectiveness.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28669734) ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1442489057381134345))
