# Management

[Linear](https://linear.app/) & [Height](https://height.app/) are nice project management tools. I use GitHub issues for all my project management tasks. Want to build a nice desktop client app for GitHub similar to [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html).

[Basecamp Employee Handbook](https://basecamp.com/handbook) has nice ideas.

## Notes

- [As a CTO, my default loop is 'First, cycle through all my employees and make sure that I have equipped them to be happy and productive in their jobs. Second, find something to do. If possible, delegate it; if not, do it. Repeat.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16802530)

- [Do you need to estimate the shit that needs to be done? No! It all needs to be done. The dev team will do it as fast as they can. Estimating the work will only waste time they could spend getting the shit done.](http://slap.pm/)

- [Bad management is so endemic in tech companies that weak managers often don't even know they are weak, and power dynamics often mean they have no motivation to improve.](https://twitter.com/hmason/status/1387494922832564224)
- [Don't be afraid to bring it up or leave under bad management.](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1395827216433438728)

- [At Shopify, we tend to do whatever our engineers want in this regard. My team meets weekly and looks at a kanban project board. If we need to adjust, we have retros, etc and change the process. We have the autonomy. IMO while you need some consistency to get alignment on goals at a high level and coarse quarter-level goals, at the team level you can more or less let the team decide and then judge them on their effectiveness.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28669734) ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1442489057381134345))
