- [My advice for young people starting out in their careers: choose leaders who are competent, compassionate, and secure in themselves (not just pretending to be).

- [How to make what you work on great: Clear vision and objective function. Great leadership. Small, elite, cross-functional teams. Focus on excellence all around. Obsession with building an amazing product that delights customers. Intellectual honesty. And intense work ethic.](https://twitter.com/laserlikemike/status/1460637838110691328)
- [Nothing destroys an organization faster than a leader with the desire to be well liked.](https://twitter.com/laserlikemike/status/1462061981758746624)
