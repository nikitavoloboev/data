## Notes

- [Wealth and access to wealth is one of the most widely experienced Accessibility issues.](https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1274376280255811584)
- Before selling things owned, can look at prices of same or similar items on marketplace and price the item accordingly.
- [“It’s not for everyone”.](https://seths.blog/2018/06/its-not-for-everyone/)
- [Many devs devalue their time enormously. ](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1316728697584381952)
- [Interesting approach to raise price based off number of items sold. Start at $10, after 30 sales, raise to $15 etc.](https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right)
- [I feel like something almost everybody gets wrong about subscription pricing in their apps is not having a ‘no brainer’ tier as an onramp. Give me a feature subset that I can live on while I get started with your app, don’t just go straight to the ’30 day trial or $50/yr’ extreme](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1388607057910239232)
- [Give away general info, charge for contextual advice. Make the value for the customer immediately obvious. Pricing should be straightforward.](https://twitter.com/VicVijayakumar/status/1424173615847772161)
- [Took me a long time to get comfortable accepting a one-time purchase business model as not being “inferior” to recurring, but there are tons of advantages. And even without subscription, our revenue is still very predictable week to week (+/- 10%). Ultimately of course it’s the type of product you’re selling and how it delivers value that should determine the pricing model, not just “whichever one you like better”. But don’t dismiss a good idea just because it wouldn’t be recurring, one-time is a very legit business model.](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1440816886996865025)
- [Many so call 'sales' don't change the price and only put the sale tag to provoke buying at the same price](https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1462909377594019843)
