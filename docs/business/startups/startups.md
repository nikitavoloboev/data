# Startups

> Take something that people do, and remove a step (or make that step very very easy). That's the key to a successful startup.

> The best startup book is one you never open because you're too busy marketing and building your product.

[YC Startup Directory](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies) is a nice thing to go over to get inspired for things to build.

## Notes

- [Put a price on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY). And sell.
- Another way to think about this, and the way we talk about this internally, is that we prefer to communicate through our products.
- I wake up every morning and think about how I can put myself out of business. By that, I mean I think about every way another business can disrupt my profit margins and my current successes. By thinking about what they could do, I can do it myself and innovate my own business.
- I need a higher level of certainty than investors do because my time is more valuable to me than their money is to them. Investors place bets in a portfolio of companies, but I only have one life.
- The most important thing you can do is to get into an iteration cycle where you can measure the impact of your work, have a hypothesis about how making changes will affect those variables, and ship changes regularly. It doesn't even matter that much what the content is - it's the iteration of hypothesis, changes, and measurement that will make you better at a faster rate than anything else we have seen.
- [Ask your users how they’d feel if they could no longer use your product. The group that answers ‘very disappointed’ will unlock product/market fit.](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)
- [When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
- [In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into trouble. They could end up on a local maximum. But in practice that never happens. … The maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated. Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)
- [This batch of not disappointed users should not impact your product strategy in any way. They’ll request distracting features, present ill-fitting use cases and probably be very vocal, all before they churn out and leave you with a mangled, muddled roadmap. As surprising or painful as it may seem, don’t act on their feedback — it will lead you astray on your quest for product/market fit.](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)
  - Politely disregard those who would not be disappointed without your product. They are so far from loving you that they are essentially a lost cause.
- [If you only double down on what users love, your product/market fit score won’t increase. If you only address what holds users back, your competition will likely overtake you.](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)
- To increase your product/market fit score, spend half your time doubling down on what users already love and the other half on addressing what’s holding others back.
- [It is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook)
- [If you don’t have product-market fit, your startup is fucked. You probably don’t have it if: You aren’t growing. You have high churn. Your product is hard to sell. Customers don’t seem to care that much. Here are some simple steps to find product-market fit.](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1133822625090719744)
- [Speed matters because frontier people like it and will go to the places where speed is possible. It maximizes their comparative advantage. If your field ceases to support speed, you’ll lose frontier people and stagnate.](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/04/does-the-speed-of-production-matter.html)
- [Under-valued skills of good startup founders: 1. Ability to create process 2. Writing clearly 3. Delaying gratification 4. Knowing when not to talk 5. Saying no to almost everything, but yes when it truly matters](https://mobile.twitter.com/AndyGCook/status/1134828886821416960)
- [Things that founders often regret](https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1184628336124841984)
- [Few founder superpowers: Knowing which questions to ask. Listening before talking. Speaking in analogies. Being able to take feedback. Uninterested in what competition is doing.](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1277287405008060416)
- [The reason you don't see more startups in the hard sciences is not due to the lack of hybrid talent as this article surmises. It's because:](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24208828)
  1. VCs are reluctant to fund capital intensive startups that have time horizons for exits that are significantly longer than software based startups
  2. The product lifecycle is so much longer, which makes it inherently much riskier. In many cases it can be years before you even get to the point where you can get real feedback on the business model.
  3. There are often other considerations e.g. regulations or interactions with existing products, that are entirely outside of the control of the company that can significantly alter the likelihood of success.
- [Produce an infoproduct (book, course, newsletter, etc) in domain X prior to a SaaS in domain X. Much quicker time to money. Gets your name out there and starts attracting happy customers. Teaches you business mechanics while paying you.](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1301562880878239745)
- [Startup advice:](https://twitter.com/gaganbiyani/status/1308062970057023489)
  1. Focus. You're a small team; just do one thing well.
  2. Weekly cadence. Build a growth team that meets weekly, instead of biweekly or quarterly.
  3. Talk like your customer. Use their language, not yours.
  4. Use less data. When you are small, obsessing over data is pointless.
  5. Replace important debates with experiments and unimportant debates with decisions.
- [Margins matter, even in the early days. \$24k/mo sounds good, but we never evaluated the COGS of this and how much it really cost us to produce our content. If we realized how low our margins were, we would have made many decisions differently. Watch your COGS.](https://twitter.com/Mat_Sherman/status/1313548708361859073)
  - Don't hire people you don't have a absolute need for or people you don't know how to train. People are expensive, so if you hire them, make sure you have something for them to do, and you make sure they do it well. If either of those two are absent, you're wasting money.
  - Your own emotional state will be thrusted onto your company whether you want it to or not. My emotions were the companies emotions. I should have had a wall, between what I felt and what people saw, but they were equal. This crushed the moral of the company, as well as my own.
  - If things are too easy, look harder for problems. Business is not easy. It isn't meant to go smoothly. If it is, try to find the reason it's so easy, and give yourself reasons something could go wrong. Because, something always goes wrong eventually.
  - Love what you do, and if you don't, be self aware. I didn't have a deep passion for PubLoft. Content was not my life's mission. We let Jason invest, and he wanted a huge outcome. but I knew pubLoft was not my life's work. Be self aware about this before you take money.
  - Keep going. It's only a failure if I don't get back up and try again.
- [The point of vesting is to exchange shares for value as the value in the form of work is provided over a period of time. In my company we just split all the shares evenly on day one with no vesting schedule.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25216709)
- [If you launch and no one notices, launch again. We launched 3 times. - Brian Chesky](https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1346628063983972353)
- [Customer service is a big differentiator for a startup. Especially in the very beginning, when you have so few users that you can deliver extremely personalized service, and it's the CEO doing it.](https://twitter.com/SamGichuru/status/1376588000335962123)
- [Product research is valuable, but if you can ship an MVP in the a similar time frame, do that instead. Real product data > everything else.](https://twitter.com/hemal/status/1382074186588332033)
- [The faster a space is moving, the more you need to bet on the people than the product.](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1391437978401116166)
