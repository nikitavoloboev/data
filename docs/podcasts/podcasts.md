## Notes

- A podcast is just people talking. Nothing magical.
- Can use QuickTime to record.
- Great opportunity to meet up with others - makes for a more fun show.
- Since it's a rather new format, there's lots of room for new concepts and new ideas.
- You don't need expensive recording studio. It's just recording conversations.
- Basic audio editing is easy to learn. You can use free tools like GarageBand and Audacity.
- Podcasts are not necessarily live. You can edit out the parts that go off topic.
- Can use a mirror for podcast interviews. Can look nice like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecKgqJRvZ5M).
- [All podcasts should have transcripts.](https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1545954156455886850)
