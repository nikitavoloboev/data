# Success

Success comes from [not giving up](https://twitter.com/harryhurst/status/1446523998943150083), doing what you love & [sharing what you learned](https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1539192654264782849).

## Notes

- Figure out what you are uniquely the best in the world at because you just love it. And then just find out who or what needs that the most.
- Doing what everybody else is doing feels like the safest thing to do. But it’s also the most competitive, which makes it the riskiest.
- If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.
- The trick with being confident, is accepting the results of an action or situation before it even happens.
- [A generally-preferable alternative to “worse is better” is, in my mind, “real artists ship”. (This is to say: availability is a prerequisite for adoption, while quality only ranks available options.)](https://lobste.rs/s/qcglg2/worse_is_worse_2003)
- [All learning is dependent on feedback. The faster the feedback, the faster you can learn. Thus, in many domains, the individual, team, or organization with the fastest feedback cycle is the one that wins.](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1084862272734937095)

- [Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money.](https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1263482890668503041)
- [The single most important factor to success is the ability to make things happen. This requires determination, resourcefulness, focus, tenacity, confidence, a willingness to look like an idiot, and an ability to do the work when no one is watching.](https://twitter.com/ShaneAParrish/status/1322967152434008064)
- [Don't be impressed by money, followers, degrees, and titles. Be impressed by kindness, integrity, humility, and generosity.](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1330178700424458243)
- [Success is when reality catches up to your imagination.](https://twitter.com/katgleason/status/1353843174398156801)
- [Do lots of experiments. Fail fast. Learn from them. Move on.](https://twitter.com/vijaypande/status/1366566096476676096)
- Create an environment that tolerates and encourages failure.

- [Imposter syndrome never goes away. I work to reframe the conversation. I'm the prototype of my role. The only comparison I can have is myself on my best day. If I was able to perform well before, then I can do it again.](https://twitter.com/bryanl/status/1379791377245016067)

I'm in my 40s and only seeing the true power now of asking for things, for help, for what you want.
