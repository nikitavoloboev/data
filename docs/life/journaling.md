# Journaling

Journaling my thoughts and experiences has been my most impactful and healthy habit I started doing in life.

I once used [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) as my digital life journal. However recently I started to journal and share my experiences publicly in [looking back](../looking-back/looking-back.md).

I started with journaling by writing [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32), evaluating my day and noting interesting and memorable things that happened to me during the day.

Journaling helps me be mindful of what I am doing and keeps me in check for what my thoughts on life are at any given time. I can be brutally honest with myself when writing there and for me its part of a cleansing process of bad and negative thoughts I feel.

If I ever feel down, I can just start writing and just release all these negative thoughts onto paper. Many times, the simple act of writing makes you realize that these things I worry about are silly and are either not in my control or simply not worth even being sad over.

I love reading these journals:

- [Fabian's retrospectives](https://capnfabs.net/tags/retrospective/)
- [Brandur's small notes on all things](https://brandur.org/fragments)
- [Matous's journals](https://dzx.cz/tags/journal/)
- [Artem Tyurin](https://agentcooper.io/)
