# Life

I try to live my life [enjoying each moment](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) and moving towards the [future I want](../future/future.md).

You [probably live only one life](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html). So best [make it count](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html).

I love the [lifestyle that Simon Sarris has](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1520430508433461250). [Built their own house](https://simonsarris.medium.com/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41) in nature. Living a [minimal life](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1517251006823866368) working on code and [building things with hands](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1485379943697723394). It's admirable.

I try to spend as much [time with family and loved ones](https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime) as I can. I live a life focused on positivity and [happiness](happiness.md) over complaining and glooming over the future.

## Notes

- [There is basically 4 ways people go about life: 1: hedonist: maximizes pleasure. 2: ascetic: maximizes inner peace. 3: nihilist: maximizes comfort. 4: creativist: makes things.](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1524262567627042816)
- [We live infinitely; the soul is the energy that cannot be destroyed and the physical body is merely a vesicle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/7mnp7f/your_number_one_most_profound_realisation_after/)
- [Life is something & yet nothing at the same time. Once you transcend basic levels of consciousness & reach this ‘awakening’ to reality there’s nothing else to do but go ON with THIS reality. Humans tend to respond to this shift of thought drastically & humanely so we over think, & over complicate things that don't need further complication. Once you realize that everything that there is & everything that ever will be along with everything that ever was, IS YOU then there’s nothing else to do but to live this life fully. Alan Watts talks about this a lot & if you have any issues with learning this ‘awakening’ I recommend listening to various lectures & recordings by this man as I think he definitely got “it” & is one of several who explain it all so clearly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/7whvuf/what_youre_experiencing_is_death_without_the/)
- Treat people as if they are in a sensitive and malleable emotional state all the time. You have the power to uplift friends and strangers with every interaction, large or small.
- [Life isn't meant to be easy. Everyone suffers in different ways. You don't deserve to be happy since the nature of reality is slow degradation of your life. Don't over estimate other people's happiness compared to your own. Life is hard for all of us. And let me tell you my friend, solitude is a blessing. It is an opportunity to discover more of yourself and your soul. And ultimately, you will always be alone whether you're in a crowded dance club or in the middle of the desert. Stop worrying about being alone. Fill your time with your passions and life will build itself around you so that you are at least slightly less miserable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8exb53/seems_i_am_destined_for_a_life_of_lonely/)
- Always feeling like you are in a race with other people is not a good way to live a life.
- [The Mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.](https://twitter.com/tanayj/status/1369478724500873223)
- [The meaning of life is to give life meaning. You don't have to do anything, but it's actually quite hard to do nothing for long. The Universe keeps changing and flowing, and we're along for the ride. Your consciousness is absolutely absurd. Focus inward and on the present moment, be with your breath and body. The direction will present itself to you, unveiling bit by bit. We have many small decisions each day that add up to what we are, based on what is handed to us. Be kind, be the Light, and the rest will come to you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/mffe0j/this_might_be_a_bit_off_topic_but_i_love_this/)

- [It doesn't matter what's real, it matters what's functional. I don't have the luxury of pessimism any more. Love, compassion, optimism, and empathy are the only way to make this construction of reality tolerable. That said, I do not take shit any more. And I absolutely do not pass it on. I am sinking and shedding off the trauma that was done to me, and I will not allow it to propagate further into the future from me. That buck stops here. I had a shitty come up, but the remainder of my life is about way more than that. I came here to do fun stuff, specifically to build big fun stuff with other people, and to help them learn how to be happier while they do it. I now know what I want to do, and I'm having fun doing it. It's a great feeling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/oxv9vt/have_psychedelicsmind_exploration_techniques/)

- [Life is just a thing that is happening to you, let it happen. Novelty occurs in things that are outside of our control, and it cannot happen if you are stuck in your own head imposing limits on yourself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/pz6oid/given_the_absurdity_of_life_how_do_you_go_about/)
