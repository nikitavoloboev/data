# Computer Science

[Functional Introduction To Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flane/FICS/), [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university), [Self learning CS](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/Self-learning-Computer-Science) & [Rust CS](https://github.com/AbdesamedBendjeddou/Rusty-CS) are great overviews of CS.

I loved reading [Code: The Hidden Language](https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/) book. It [explains computing very well from ground up](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31696901).

## Notes

- Turing machines are not the only theoretical model that can be used to define computation.
