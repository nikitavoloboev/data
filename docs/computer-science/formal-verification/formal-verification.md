title: Formal verification
---

# [Formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification)

[Program = Proof](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/teaching/INF551/course.pdf) is a nice book.

## Notes

- [I like to start with a full english description, and then write things as FOL predicates. The act of translating it into math, even "sloppy" math, is a great first past for seeing issues more clearly. If it passes that, then I move on to FM.](https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1476378372724998150)
