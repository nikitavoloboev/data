# [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

[DockerSlim](https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim) is useful. Seems everyone is moving to [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) now.

Try to [avoid using Docker](https://twitter.com/iansu/status/1555255026666258432) for [Nix](../../package-managers/nix/nix.md) which can even [build Docker images](https://lobste.rs/s/ilgax7/use_flake_nix_not_dockerfile) if you need them.
