# Remote work

## Notes

- [Remote work tip: Leave a Zoom open that anyone on the team can drop by during some predictable hours. No specific agenda.](https://twitter.com/dksf/status/1308799667153432576)
- [Running a Remote Company ≠ Working From Home. It means the freedom to set your own work hours, work from anywhere (cafes, travel, co-working) and live where you want.](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1317911134704340992)
- [Normalize recess for adults. Walking away from my computer to explore the neighborhood at some point between 1p - 3p has done more for me than any corporate mental health app ever.](https://twitter.com/emhaasch/status/1369408335313780743)
- [Remote work rewards writers.](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1381603968489381896)
- [Companies mandating company-wide time off days, where EVERYBODY at the company takes the same day off (hoping to help with burnout/pandemic breathing room) is helpful.](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/1382087784974798849)
- [Just because you work from home, doesn’t mean you have to be available 24/7 for work.](https://twitter.com/catalinmpit/status/1388809429806686213)
- [Remote work has tons of benefits, but a dangerous disadvantage that isn't talked about enough is that the internet can start to replace your real-life social circles. Really important to combat that, or you can start taking things here way too seriously.](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1395835514473877508)
- [Unless you are regularly meeting up in the office in person, only time zone matters. And then once you go outside the same time zone (+/- 3 hours), you need to design everything for full async.](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1421855752688336903)
- [Firm-wide remote work causes a shift to async communication (not more meetings) and makes workers’ collaboration network more siloed.](https://twitter.com/ylongqi/status/1435985696892678148)
- [I don’t know if I would ever be able to readjust back to the non-remote-first office work. It just feels natural to hop to a plane (train, car) and get somewhere without skipping a beat of your work. To have it safely detached from the matters of physical presence and geography.](https://twitter.com/inazarova/status/1442751094111838208)
- [The third founder with a remote team sharing the same story: An engineer they hired did great on the interviews but worked unexplainably slow day to day. When pairing: they worked fast. They stopped pairing: slowed down. Turns out, the person had a second job in all cases.](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1445854500443537414)
- [Steve Jobs and I became close friends. We went for long walks at Castle Rock State Park, shared meals and wide-ranging conversations about life and design. We bounced ideas off each other. Sometimes he would start a conversation with "Here's a crazy idea...", and the idea would go back and forth and evolve into a serious discussion, or occasionally a workable design. Steve listened to me and challenged me. His support at Apple allowed me to made a difference in the world](https://focusmark.hashnode.dev/what-worries-me-about-remote-work)
- [Linear does nice all team bake/cook together over zoom once a quarter](https://twitter.com/karrisaarinen/status/1453821275307077646)
- [A single in person meeting with a coworker brought me closer to them than a year of weekly zoom 1:1s. claiming there’s no difference feels delusional to me.](https://twitter.com/gem_ray/status/1455218628358402048)
- [Meetings create alignment. The minute after a meeting you start drifting. Drift is higher in low-trust environments. Too many (long) meetings are a sign of dysfunctional organizations. Either there is no trust, no alignment, or neither.](https://twitter.com/cpojer/status/1516745858741862406)
- [If calls and meetings would work I'd do them but it's always chit chat and after call absolutely nothing practical happens. A chat message is much faster/better/async.](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1518514157272068096)
- [The eight hour work day and two day weekend is obsolete. We should expect at most a six hour work day and at least three days off for every four days of work.](https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1520974703820742658)
