## Questions to ask

- [Describe a few of the hardest problems you solved & exactly how you solved them.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1324736076800577537)

## Notes

- [We’ve made an incredible innovation in hiring: Pay someone to do the work they would be doing if they get the job. If they are able to do it, they get the job.](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1260196779905052678)
- [Do pilot projects for hiring instead of traditional interview with questions](https://overcast.fm/+Y-HUXijTI).
- [Your job post should be an expression of your culture and values. If you value transparency, your job post should be as transparent as possible.](https://twitter.com/davidvfurlong/status/1354088604826558465)
- [Your first 10 hires set the stage for your company’s talent bar and culture. Spend a lot of time with them pre-hire. Get them to work with you for a day or even a week. You’re looking for diamonds in the rough. Known quantities are starting companies or joining sure things.](https://twitter.com/jaltma/status/1358497813076713474)
- [Take more bets on people early in their careers.](https://twitter.com/anothercohen/status/1384657538201710598)
- [Every employee’s one thing was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing.](https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1388612463768215553)
- [Normalize telling candidates when their ask is significantly below market rate. Nothing cute about underpaying people who are still figuring things out.](https://twitter.com/TheYelitsa/status/1394757802422423555)
- [Offer both early exercises and 10 year extended exercise window. Do it right after you raise a priced round and start granting options. That way you only have to change few lines in the options plan. It will be more painful to do later.](https://twitter.com/karrisaarinen/status/1397561196232863754)
- [Day Bridge options can be exercised as soon as they vest, and can be exercised long after you leave. You can also leave before fully vesting. They are also EMI approved (very tax efficient) and the strike price is currently ~£0.](https://twitter.com/kieranmch/status/1397612206800375816)
- [У нас собеседование не идёт в реальном времени — кандидат пишет текстом большой ответ на все наши вопросы сразу. Общаемся лично только в самом конце. Проверка на культуру — самая сложная. Её надо проводить с минимальным потоком людей, когда отсеяли по остальным критериям](https://twitter.com/andrey_sitnik/status/1419261221681999874)
- [The best people you hire are awesome pretty much immediately. Slow starters rarely become stars.](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1424431446823895043)
- [Mandatory PTO, besides being good for the wellness of the employees, ensures nobody in your org is solely relied on for a task or responsibility. Nobody should be a keystone. Smart leaders should make PTO hours taken over x time a deliverable.](https://twitter.com/r0wdy_/status/1443595429271285762)
- [Don’t evaluate others based on their function, but rather their contribution to the mission. Recruiters are an extension of your team.](https://twitter.com/laserlikemike/status/1459534198318854151)
- [Job posts of the future: Here's a task. We'll pay you to do it. If we're both happy, we'll keep going.](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1466076624189902851)
- [Training new hires: 1. Prepare good documentation. 2. Be on a call with them when you have to explain stuff verbally. 3. Be available in text chat to answer their questions.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29376226)
- [Hiring more won’t make you go faster because the output of your projects follows a power law. When constrained by people, you focus on the 1-2 most critical bottlenecks. When you have extra people they work on non-bottlenecks, which does nothing to increase overall speed.](https://twitter.com/chrismanfrank/status/1492316698287824900)
- [If the CEO of a company is not spending >25% of their time recruiting, than that is a lifestyle business.](https://twitter.com/auren/status/1498490020524666880)
- [Deadly mistake for founders and organizational leaders is to treat hiring a large team as a sign of success. Hiring should be treated as a last resort when your business will start failing without more engineers, sales people or customer success people. Otherwise you’re Fast.](https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1515536521884942339)
- [Biggest mistake founders make is they don't let go of under-performing hires quick enough. Then they do it wrong. Be direct. It should not be a surprise. It should be a continuation from prior discussions. No fluff, no excuses, be clear, state the facts.](https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1521116776238665730)
