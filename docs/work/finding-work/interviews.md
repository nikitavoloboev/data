# Interviews

[Your ultimate guide to interview preparation](http://adilet.org/blog/your-ultimate-guide-to-interview-preparation/) is an amazing guide that covers pretty much everything you need to know to prepare & pass a technical interview.

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or [Replit](https://replit.com/) are great platform for conducting live coding interviews for free.

## Nice questions to ask

- [What is the entire process for a one line change in code to make it to production?](https://twitter.com/jeremykahne/status/1469416655168196620)

## Notes

- [Never think that a job interview is a one-way interview. At least, personally, I always am interviewing the potential team as well. No, you don't have all the control as the interviewer.](https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/989878115710263297)
- [Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has developed an "Alternative Interview Framework" that involves:](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1079502682807664640)
  - 2 interviewers at a time
  - sharing questions with candidates ahead of time
  - working on actual problems the team is facing
  - blind feedback
- When trying to solve problems for understanding, don't blindly copy other's solutions. Read their solutions and take notes. Then reimplement from the notes.
- [In my experience the best candidates speculate rather than giving up, ask appropriate clarifying questions, and take end-to-end ownership of each answer by synthesising disparate discussion into a coherent final explanation.](https://twitter.com/kieranmch/status/1215385877112815617)
- [You don't need to know the answer (let's be honest, the interviewer didn't know it in details either) to actually talk about why the problem exists and what you understand about it.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24460286)
- If you find someone who is capable of just getting things done and learning what they need to, that's all that matters. If they can google their way around and find the answer, then who cares what was in their brain the minute before, at the end of the day they solved the problem.
- [Here's what I look for in an interview: 1. Clear communication. 2. The humility to say "I don't know". 3. Can discuss the tradeoffs of different approaches. 4. Seems excited to learn more and grow.](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1383077932621557765)
