# Finding work

This article on [interviewing, applying and getting your first job in iOS](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/01/30/iOS-Junior-Interviews) is superb. So as this [general guide on getting a senior level software role](https://www.jobsearch.dev/).

I made a curated list of ways to prepare and places to look to [find work programming](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/find-work).

I use [Otta](https://otta.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) & [AngelList](https://angel.co) and the [monthly HN: Who is hiring? threads](https://kennytilton.github.io/whoishiring/) for finding interesting work opportunities to apply to.

I made [my CV](https://nikiv.dev/cv.pdf) using [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template in [LaTeX](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/cv).

Sometimes the most effective way to apply is to apply directly. Go to the website of the company you want to apply to and see if there is a `Jobs` section present somewhere and apply through it. You can also send a direct email to the company's hiring management or if it's a startup, you can send an email to the Founder directly.

I use a similar message for all my direct emails:

```
Hi ..,

I saw you're looking for a .. at .. and I'm interested in joining your team.

{Why I want to join and think I am good fit..}

I attached my CV for further information, let me know if you'd be interested in talking.

[Nikita](https://nikiv.dev/)
```

Never let impostor syndrome or anything else stop you from applying to your dream jobs. Most requirements placed on the job boards are not set in stone. If you know how to learn fast and know things already that are related, apply! Don't let rejections discourage you, ever. It's a numbers game and the first jobs are always the hardest to get.

My other favorite way of finding interesting work opportunities is meeting and interacting with people personally through various events and getting to know what they're building.

I track jobs I found interesting in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Jobs-8f4225788b144da49a0c2ee37576507c).

Companies that do [location-based pay bands](https://twitter.com/kyleve/status/1519908090983841793) are horrible.

## Notes

- Sort by newest jobs in websites and check regularly and apply then.
- [If asked previous salary, you can answer `As per contract, I'm not at liberty to disclose this.`.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/9ohap7/uk_company_asking_about_current_salary_up_front/)
- [2 years is a very normal amount of time to stay at a job before moving on. "Moving on" can include "promotion".](https://twitter.com/seldo/status/1381603198754975748)
- ["Job hopping" is a symptom of fake promises given by management. Grass looks greener when interviewing, you hardly know what the day to day work will be like before joining. Exiting fast is better in my book than wasting time in a miserable situation.](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1381599321200553990)
- [3 Ways to Get Promoted: 1. You have a supportive boss that follows-through. 2. You have a kick-ass internal network supporting you (peers, sponsors, mentors, etc). 3. Jump to a different company.](https://twitter.com/lcooney/status/1384948385078185984)
- [You don't get a promotion by doing your job really well. you get a promotion by doing a different job.](https://twitter.com/fat/status/1393287585380790272)
- [Want to break into tech and work at a startup? Research a company, find the founder(s) on Twitter, and DM them a note about why you’re excited and what value you bring. DMs are open and every founder is looking for passionate, talented people.](https://twitter.com/anothercohen/status/1400942834396459011)
- [I personally don't count stock options in total compensation. Stock units (RSUs) that are given to you, yes. But options that you have to buy, I don't.](https://twitter.com/cassidoo/status/1420423346727051268)
- [Уволиться — это не кинуть. Отказаться от оффера — тоже. Что с одной, что с другой компанией ничего не случится независимо от того, куда ты пойдешь. Там даже никто не расстроится, хмыкнут, пожмут плечами и пойдут работать дальше. Идти надо в новое место, потому что кругозор. Даже если будет чуть хуже, новый опыт, знания и знакомства того стоят. Чем больше мир посмотришь, тем круче как специалист.](https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1453691923651309571)
