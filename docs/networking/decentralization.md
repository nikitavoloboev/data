# [Decentralization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization)

## Notes

- [The hardest problem in censorship resistance is the challenge of getting humans to split their stake between many independent validators. Defi is going to drive censorship resistance, and is really our only hope of achieving a truly censorship resistant global network.](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1388148048639905792)
- [Decentralization is a quantifiable measurable thing. It’s: 1. Cost to censor. 2. Cost to destroy all replicas. Any chain that charges users above 4x the hardware costs to provide decentralization will get passed by a cheaper and faster and more decentralized network.](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1441904519877566466)
- [Decentralized technical systems do not necessarily produce decentralized political power.](https://twitter.com/keikreutler/status/1442438737678544896)
- [The economic reward function is very important. As long as there are uncapped returns, centralization is inevitable.](https://twitter.com/BlackForestBoi/status/1442444302408470530)
- [Web1: content distributed to users. Web2: content produced by users and distributed to users. Web3: content produced by users and distributed to users on user controlled platforms.](https://twitter.com/ArthurB/status/1444620432280330241)
- [Web 3: People create + People profit](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1453712519919403016)
- [Decentralization doesn't mean the absence of leaders but the abundance of them.](https://twitter.com/Echecrates/status/1458589782427279366)
- [The most important (and least understood) change of the millennium thus far is that decentralisation and incentives have given _sovereignty_ to machines. We now build machines that nobody can turn off. They live unto themselves.](https://twitter.com/samecwilliams/status/1463389066100154368)
- [In web2, you are just borrowing things — until the actual owners change their mind.](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1470374120055615488)
- [Core requirements for a 'metaverse': 1. Composable: built from untrusted parts. 2. Open: like the web, no single owner. 3. Multiplayer-capable. Everything else (3D, VR, ownership models, etc.) is related but not core to what makes the 'metaverse' concept different.](https://twitter.com/kettlecorn/status/1499061977833955329)
