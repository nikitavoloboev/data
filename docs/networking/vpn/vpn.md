# [VPN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)

[WireGuard](wireguard.md) & [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) are great although not strictly a VPN. I personally use [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) for whenever I need a VPN.

## Hosted solutions

There is always a trust issue having VPN hosted by third party. Especially if it's free!
