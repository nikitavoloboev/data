[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is great. [HTTPie](https://github.com/httpie/httpie) & [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.tech/) are useful.

[Status code summary](https://twitter.com/tlakomy/status/1528499152472129536) ([as cats](https://http.cat/)):

```
1xx: hold on
2xx: here you go
3xx: go away
4xx: you fucked up
5xx: I fucked up
```
