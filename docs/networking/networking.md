# Networking

This [article](https://drewdevault.com/2016/12/06/A-broad-intro-to-networking.html) is great intro.

## Notes

- `127.0.0.1` is localhost.
- Can go to `Network` tab to see details about requests and why they failed if they did fail. Can view headers etc
- Web browsers will try to connect over port 80 by default.
- [Best way to poll REST API? Timer seems fine. If the data is really changing frequently a WebSocket seems more appropriate.
  If it’s changing infrequently but you wanna know right away, a silent push notification is the “right” way but that requires some infrastructure](https://twitter.com/_dte/status/1265606739564662785)
