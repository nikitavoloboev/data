title: Unix Shell
---

# [Unix Shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)

Use [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) as my terminal & [Zsh](zsh/zsh.md) as my shell. [Fish](fish.md) & [Oil](https://www.oilshell.org/) seem like great shell alternatives. [Pipr](https://github.com/elkowar/pipr) seems useful.

[ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is great for linting scripts. [How Warp works](https://www.warp.dev/blog/how-warp-works) is a great read.

## Variables

All active variables can be seen by running `env`.

- `$HOME` - Expands to the path of my home folder.
- `$PS1` - Variable that represents my command prompt line.
- `$PATH` - Special environment variable that contains the command path (list of system directories that the shell searches when trying to locate a command).

## Notes

- Scripts are run in subshells, and nothing is shared "upwards". That's the difference between running a script and sourcing one. A sourced (imported) script is run in your own script's namespace.
- In shell everything is a string.
- Children never touch parent environment. It can only if it runs as part of the current process (source, function, alias).
- Pipes are used to connect one process's output with another process’s input.
- `/etc/paths.d` define paths to add to `$PATH` globally to all users.
