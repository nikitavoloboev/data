# [Zsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)

My shell of choice. My config for it can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh).

## Notes

- Exported variables get passed on to child processes. Non-exported variables do not.
- I don't need to add `function` text before function definition.
- Search `zshall` man page to find all zsh widgets and more things.
- I can use `zsh/zprof` to profile zsh startup time. Docs for it can be seen in `zshmodules`.
- `zsh -x` - See what Zsh executes when it starts new shell.
- [`cmd -` and TAB will list options for command.](https://twitter.com/rsms/status/1304877145743790080)

## Code

```bash
# Read function definition
whence -f ..

# See where the it was defined
whence -v
```

```bash
# Bind comand to alt key
# alt+i will run 'a' command.
# \e means opt key
bindkey -s '\ei' '^Ua^M'
```

```bash
# See what is binded to a key
# See what is binding to ⌃ + E
bindkey '^E'
```

```bash
# Run zsh without sourcing zshrc
zsh -f
```

```bash
# Set alias to external command
alias fin='command fd'
```

```bash
# List all bindings
bindkey
```
