# Blogs

I use [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) to stay on top of blogs I like.

At some point I used [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/).

I separate blogs I follow by quality into `1.` & `2.` folders accordingly.

I share my [XML subscription feed of blogs I follow](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/63b5d2418122fcd6949d854dc5080689). I also follow some people on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/following).

My blog is written with [Solid](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) ([code here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikitavoloboev)).

[Deno Blog](https://github.com/denoland/deno_blog) ([example code](https://github.com/ry/tinyclouds)) is also a pretty minimal blog implementation. [Proselog](https://github.com/proselog/proselog) looks interesting too.

[Bartosz Ciechanowski's Blog](https://ciechanow.ski/) is absolutely incredible.
