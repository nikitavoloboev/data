# Staying on top of things

There is a lot happening in the world every single minute. It's hard to not feel like you are constantly _missing out_ on things.

The truth is that it's a battle you can't win as your time is limited. Thus you should focus on things that truly matter to you. [Mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) is what helps me keep my focus.

Here are things I do/use to keep my self up to date on things I care about efficiently.

## Links

I use [custom script](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/go/blob/main/cmd/savelink/main.go) to quickly save links to check later. In future I hope to use Learn Anything to handle this.

High priority links/notes are sent as messages to myself on Telegram. I also have bindings to save snapshots of my current tabs on mac into a session I can come back later to.

## What I use

I try to stay in touch using these few things:

### Twitter with [Tweetbot](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md)

Twitter is my favorite social media network and it is where I share everything [I am personally up to](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) right now. I love Twitter for its ability to tailor completely what news and tweets I am actually reading. I split Tweetbot into [two columns](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md) on mac. And I use official Twitter iOS app.

### [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)

They are my two favorite news aggregators on the web. I like Lobsters for its smaller community and quite often better links and discussions.

I mostly use [Hckr News](https://hckrnews.com/) and/or [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/newest) sorted by new. [HN Front](https://news.ycombinator.com/front) is nice too to get a full day coverage of posts. And [HN Search](https://hn.algolia.com/) is great too.

### Reddit

My Reddit is heavily tailored to my own likes and I very often just look into some subreddits I like to see what is new.

Here is [multireddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/2DoApp+AdvancedFitness+AlanWatts+AskComputerScience+AskHistorians+AskMen+AskNetsec+AskProgramming+Automate+Bogleheads+CGPGrey+Clojure+Coffee+Compilers+Coq+CryptoTechnology+Cyberpunk_Music+Design+DrugNerds+Entrepreneur+EuropeFIRE+EveryLittleAnimation+EverythingScience+FIREUK+Fitness+Futurology+GonWildCurvy+GraphicsProgramming+HumanMicrobiome+Immunology+InternetIsBeautiful+Julia+LaTeX+Letterboxd+LoRaWAN+Lora+MLQuestions+MacOS+MachineLearning+Meditation+Microbiome+MusicForConcentration+Neuralink+NixOS+NoStupidQuestions+Nootropics+OutOfTheLoop+Pet_Renaissance+Physics+PlantBasedDiet+PostgreSQL+PourPainting+ProgrammerTIL+ProgrammingLanguages+PsychedelicStudies+Python+REMath+RISCV+Racket+RationalPsychonaut+ReverseEngineering+Showerthoughts+SiriShortcuts+SoftwareEngineering+SublimeText+SwiftUI+TheeHive+TrueFilm+UKInvesting+UKPersonalFinance+WeAreTheMusicMakers+WireGuard+ZeroWaste+agda+algorithms+ambientmusic+analog+apljk+apolloapp+apple+artificial+askdrugs+askscience+aws+bioinformatics+blog+boardgames+bodyweightfitness+cardano+chan+coding+cogsci+compsci+computerscience+cpp+csbooks+cscareerquestions+cscareerquestionsEU+darknetplan+dataisbeautiful+datascience+dependent_types+devops+elixir+elm+embedded+erlang+ethereum+europe+explainlikeimfive+explorables+fatFIRE+financialindependence+genetics+getdisciplined+golang+gonwild+haskell+history+homeautomation+iOSProgramming+investing+iosdev+javascript+kubernetes+leangains+learnanythingxyz+learnart+learnmachinelearning+learnprogramming+lectures+lisp+listentothis+longevity+macosprogramming+macprogramming+math+mathbooks+mildlyinteresting+minimalism+neuro+neuroscience+nextjs+nutrition+ocaml+osdev+photocritique+photography+privacy+programming+programmingtools+pytorch+reactjs+reactnative+reasonml+reinforcementlearning+rust+scala+science+selfhosted+shittychangelog+shortcuts+singularity+solotravel+spacex+startups+statistics+swift+sysadmin+tinycode+triphop+types+typescript+u_BluePinkGrey+u_Borax+u_ChristoferK+u_Cindori+u_CompuIves+u_DizzyEwok+u_DontStealStories+u_ElvishJerricco+u_LunarStone+u_Odersky+u_SrPeixinho+u_StingrayZ+u__philpl+u_algernone+u_caliform+u_cmsj+u_deanishe+u_desiringmachines+u_dlgn13+u_edwardkmett+u_emersion_fr+u_isovector+u_jamesknelson+u_japaric+u_jerf+u_k0001+u_karlicoss+u_kennethreitz+u_majid8+u_mittsh+u_mstoiber+u_nat_friedman+u_nglgzz+u_notoriousrdc+u_nrinaudo+u_nullc+u_quchen+u_robpike+u_rperciav+u_rvolosatovs+u_sfvisser+u_sobolevn+u_sobri909+u_spez+u_spladug+u_swyx+u_tazjin+u_terrorjack+u_tiss93+u_tuhdo+u_uhoreg+userexperience+veganfitness+veganketo+videography+vim+vim_magic+vscode+web_design+webdev+zeronet/) of subreddits I am subbed too. Less priority subs are put in [Other list](https://www.reddit.com/user/nikivi/m/other).

There is also nice [list of Reddit subs](https://github.com/learn-anything/reddit). I access all these subreddits using [Deanishe's Reddit worklfow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-reddit).

### RSS with [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/)

I follow [many blogs](blogs.md).

### IRC

I love using IRC via [Matrix](../networking/matrix.md) and hanging out in various channels of Freenode. Mostly as a way to get help with an issue that I can't solve on my own after searching for everything.

### [Pinboard (popular)](https://pinboard.in/popular/)

I sometimes check it out as it does contain some interesting links.

### Medium

I follow few publications and writers on Medium. I then view new articles from my feed [here](https://medium.com/stream/network).

### Communities and forums I frequent

I spend a lot of my time on [LA Discord server](https://discord.gg/bxtD8x6aNF) to discuss LA development. As well as [macOS/iOS automation Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw).
