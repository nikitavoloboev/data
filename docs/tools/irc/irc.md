# [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)

Don't spend time on IRC any more as it's UX is not great.

I have [Matrix](../../networking/matrix.md) with [Element](https://element.io) setup to connect to some [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) channels.

Although not sure how active they are still.

I once used [Textual](../../macOS/apps/textual.md) IRC client and [ZNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZNC) network bouncer (via [LunarBNC](https://lunarbnc.net)) to always keep me logged in to the servers as well as it keeping history logs when I am away.

## IRC commands

Textual keeps a command reference [here](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Command-Reference.kb).

- `/list` - Open channel list.
- `/msg *nickserv set <yourNSpassword>` - Lets Nickserv autologin you. Can then run `/nick <your-nick>` to login.

## Notes

- If I ever get issues with logging in and me being Guest. I can: 1. `/msg NickServ RELEASE <nickname> <password>` 2. `/nick nikivi` my nick
