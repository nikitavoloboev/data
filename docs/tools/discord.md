# [Discord](https://discord.com)

[Harmony](https://github.com/harmonyland/harmony) & [Discord.ts](https://github.com/oceanroleplay/discord.ts) seem like nice bot libraries.

I like the pattern that forces use of threads in channels. So any message you make to a room, thread will be made so further messages within that context are in a thread. Also you are blocked for adding new threads for ~ 1/2 minutes. [Svelte Discord server](https://svelte.dev/chat) does this well.
