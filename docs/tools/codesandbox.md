# [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)

CodeSandbox is neat. Especially in how it lets anyone easily collaborate and fork off any change into [workable branches shareable with an URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYOjF1dFt4g). [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) is amazing alternative that is often faster too. [Replit](https://replit.com/) is neat too.
