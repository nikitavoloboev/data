# [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

Looking into building plugins for Raycast to compare it to [Alfred](../macOS/apps/alfred/alfred.md) I use a lot of. [SOL](https://github.com/ospfranco/sol) & [Script Kit](https://www.scriptkit.com/) seem neat too.

## Extensions

- [Airport](https://www.raycast.com/siddharthsharma94/airport) - Discover TestFlight Apps.
- [Vercel Deployments](https://www.raycast.com/matt/vercast) - Quickly open and check the status of your Vercel deployments. ([Code](https://github.com/gleich/vercast)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/jclem/raycast-github)
- [Personal Notion Raycast Extension](https://github.com/jclem/raycast-notion)
- [1Password extension for Raycast](https://github.com/dteare/raycast-1password-extension)
- [Sourcegraph for Raycast](https://github.com/bobheadxi/raycast-sourcegraph) - Search code, browse Notebooks, and manage Batch Changes.

## Notes

- [Raycast supports using React to render things (transforms react to native AppKit).](https://developers.raycast.com/faq)
- [90% of Mac apps should actually be Raycast extensions](https://twitter.com/benjitaylor/status/1499400441884393473)
