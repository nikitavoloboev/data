# [XState](https://xstate.js.org/)

I [model state machines by first listing events (press/do something), tasks (side effects, split by services (long running and you care about them ending) and actions (sync, take no time at all)) together with lifecycle (when it's active)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wykDyFwr8Lk). Services can spawn events.

This [guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4ocSi17y1JmMmz7S5cV8vI) & [docs](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/start.html) are great.

[Timsy](https://github.com/christianalfoni/timsy) is a nice lean alternative to XState.

## Notes

- [When should you use XState? When you have something complex to build, with: 1. Many side effects, especially long-running ones like call recording. 2. Sequences of things that MUST happen in a certain order (choose devices, record, preview). Either dead simple (useState) or everything else (XState).](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1451486390911373314)
- [I use XState anytime I have to write my own useState and it is more than a single boolean per component, or anytime I'd use useEffect.](https://twitter.com/triangulo_dev/status/1451533181329547304)
