# [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)

[Reflect](https://reflect.app/)/[RemNote](https://www.remnote.com/) is a cleaner implementation of Roam's biderectional linking. I personally use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)/[SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/). [Nota](https://nota.md/) is neat too.

## Notes

- [Always grow your systems iteratively. I think part of what “true” Roamanship is is to reduce any and all sources of friction when adding new things, including the need to keep things neat and tidy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/ie8la8/how_do_you_deal_with_a_chaotic_database/)
- [I use Roam as a journal. A book review place. Where I learn. My Daily Notes is a template, so that it helps me choose what to write, then its a daily logbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/igfnkv/roam_workflow/)
