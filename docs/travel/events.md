# Events

I love meeting new people. Best places to meet people are usually events of some kind. As well as asking to meet for coffee or just a virtual call.

I add any person I found interesting to [my contacts](../macOS/apps/contacts.md). [Luma](https://lu.ma/) is my preferred way to organize events. [Guild](https://beta.guild.host/) seems nice too.
