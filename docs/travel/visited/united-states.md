# United States

Would love to live/move to US one day but [they don't make it easy](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1520132242672029696). It was always my dream to work at company like Apple/Tesla and they mostly/only hire in US.

I like [John Mearsheimer](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=John+Mearsheimer), [George Friedman](https://twitter.com/george_friedman) & [Squirrel](https://twitter.com/zei_squirrel)'s analysis in regards to US foreign policy.

## Notes

- [Most cost-effective way (aka costs nothing) to get to work in the US is to get hired by a multinational Corp and after 1 year get an L visa and move to the US.](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1280953429527900160)
- [US has exit tax when renouncing citizenship if net worth is $2m+ or high federal taxes or not compliant; easier to leave before triggering. If just leaving to live overseas, you still must file and pay USA subject to exclusions, treaties, credits, etc](https://twitter.com/nomadcapitalist/status/1454574254566019080)
- [If the USA had a core KPI, it would be immigration. It has a monopoly on ambitious migrants—if that disappears, the product inevitably fails.](https://twitter.com/cpaik/status/1459534475042435083)
- [Puerto Rico due to Act 60 decree allows you to pay no capital gains for 15 years, while keeping US citizenship.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/rj6iju/moving_form_switzerland_to_the_beautiful_united/)
- [Allowing 54 units/acre as-of-right citywide would solve most US cities' housing affordability crisis in a span of like two years.](https://twitter.com/mnolangray/status/1515081757883731971)
- [Average US billionaire effectively pays a 3.4% tax rate while the average worker pays 25%.](https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1516078047740502026)
- [One of the things that boggles my mind about living in the US is how deeply individualism permeates every aspect of life. there’s no sense of community or a relational identity, really. It’s just every person onto their own at the end of the day. It’s very sad.](https://twitter.com/most_opppressed/status/1516802246087950338)
- ["Democracy" in America is and has always been "government by capital". The original idea was that private wealth should drive government rather than family nobility. That's why only landowners voted, that's why the 3/5 compromise, etc.](https://twitter.com/izs/status/1521467530098864128)
