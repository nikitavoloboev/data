# Germany

Quite sad that [Germany government](https://twitter.com/ViolavonCramon/status/1535621476707098624) decided to appease [Russia](russia.md) with its policies of [minimal military help to Ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/vuru3u/ukraine_cant_have_natostyle_security_guarantees/) due to fear of getting cut off from Russia's gas supply. Which would indeed [destroy a large portion of EU economy](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/vuru3u/comment/iffwkh2/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This reliance on Russian energy export is the only reason the Ukraine war was allowed to happen in the first place.

What's even more tragic is that some [minor political 'green party' managed to ban off nuclear in Germany](https://twitter.com/mark_lynas/status/1545345583262695424). I hope things change and change soon because further reliance on non EU made energy sources means no good prosperous future for whole of EU. There's lots of fascinating research happening to [solve fusion](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-the-future-of-fusion) so will see. Although some say even that [won't fix the energy problem in Germany/EU](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32104875).

Aside from those geopolitical failures, Germany seems like a nice place to live in if you ignore the super high taxes. Berlin is [one of](visited.md) my favorite cities to visit. The food and people there are amazing.

## Notes

- [Germany, particularly Berlin, have a pretty vibrant startup eco-system. If you are just trying ideas, there is no need to register a business (legally you only have to do this once you intend to follow through long term). You can register a business for 35€ - most cities offer this online. Registering a limited liability company is a little more complicated (you need a 1h appointment with a notary), but can be done from 500€ onwards. If you plan to do less than 50.000€ in revenue this year you qualify as a micro business and don‘t need to file or pay VAT. You only need to file an annual account within a year of the financial year ending. Cost of this starts at around 500€. Our legal system and corporate culture is set up in a way that you are very unlikely to be sued for damages. So even medium sized companies (several million in revenue) frequently operate as full liability companies.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31622265)

- [Germany is pretty much the most approachable option for plenty of non-EU skilled workers, especially in IT. If you're European and you're not experienced, UK and especially Switzerland are still more restrictive from what I'm noticing. The only remaining option is Netherlands where for non-EU people opportunities seem to be less numerous and citizenship potential much less likely. Germany is definitely one of the better options even though the tax system is beyond dumb imo (if your net income is 57k you pay the same portion for taxes and social contributions as someone who earns 250k, that is laughably stupid in my view, but it doesn't change the fact that Germany has a lot to offer)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/rmvie4/i_think_there_should_be_more_focus_on_net_salary/)
