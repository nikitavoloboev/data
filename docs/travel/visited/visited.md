# Visited

I keep a list of [places I liked visiting](https://www.google.com/maps/placelists/list/1t_jW3zR93T4wMQCQPo1aBbcS61A) and ones I [want to visit](https://www.google.com/maps/placelists/list/T6SMXQdXBoOPiXTheDQpDiUce_Ffyw).

From places I've been to thus far, I loved visiting Edinburgh and Berlin the most. Living in Amsterdam and London was great too, so many things happening all the time.
