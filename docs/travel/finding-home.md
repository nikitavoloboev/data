# Finding homes

I use [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com) & [Booking](https://www.booking.com) for finding temporary places to stay when traveling.

I use [FB groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/) / [Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) for finding/selling places to stay in.

One day it would be nice to own a house with a lot of windows for light like [this one](https://twitter.com/nikstep/status/1443874686333603863).

## Notes

- For putting the place up for rent goes through the same websites. Make nice photos, add nice description. Upload it on FB Marketplace and cross post it to all the relevant rent/sell groups. As well as post on other sites like SpareRoom for extra exposure.

- [I want a good shower, good stove, warm lighting at night, foresty incense, surround sound speakers, cozy desk, sun lit during the day, and a nice bed. I actually prefer the house to be small, as I like spending most of my time in nature. Luckily this lifestyle isn't expensive.](https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1437473118596083712)
- [Minimize furniture to essentials. Art must be meaningful. I'm not going to put up posters etc. No useless kitchen gadgets. Digital plastic stuff. I hate cords, speakers, TVs, lights, things that beep and blink.](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1521983183633489920)
