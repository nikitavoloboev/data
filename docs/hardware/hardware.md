# Hardware

[Digital Design and Computer Architecture course](https://safari.ethz.ch/digitaltechnik/spring2021/doku.php?id=start), [From Nand to Tetris](https://github.com/ghaiklor/nand-2-tetris) are great.

[teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/) & [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) make gorgeous and functional devices.

[Chisel](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) seems like an amazing framework for hardware designs.
