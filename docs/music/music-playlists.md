# Music playlists

## Spotify

I made and share a lot of [my Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev). It includes a playlist of [all songs I liked](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn?si=TAzeKp_KT0yEycMrjt6IcA), songs I [loved the most](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2N82DnDsPGMnpJhN8sVFJu?si=0dHcV0nIT_2JPii-htjlAA) and a playlist of [songs to focus to](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ESjwZeTcHOWzY3FYO5zs5?si=kzUDV8RQQjifiMx6YrISPg).

I use folders to neatly separate playlists I like.
