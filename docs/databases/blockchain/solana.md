> Web-Scale Blockchain for fast, secure, scalable, decentralized apps and marketplaces.

Diving into [building dApps](https://hackmd.io/@ironaddicteddog/solana-starter-kit) with Solana. This [article](https://lu.ma/p/3nHEa7k5DABpzE6/The-Solana-Programming-Model) & [thread](https://twitter.com/ayushmenon_/status/1476294409205526534) are nice intro guides. [Anchor](https://book.anchor-lang.com/) is best framework.

I buy SOL with [FTX](https://ftx.com/referrals#a=58425911) (SEPA transfer) and [stake](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/soeadc/where_are_you_staking_your_solana/) some in FTX itself.

If I need to use the coins, I transfer it to to [Glow Wallet](https://glow.app/) ([Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/) is nice too). Staking in [Marinade](https://marinade.finance/app/staking) is also great as you can use mSOL you get back in some [mSOL liquidity pool](https://marinade.finance/app/mnde) or [Solend](https://solend.fi) (not sure how useful that is) or some other way. If I need liquidity, I [unstake (slowly)](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/p1p1h1/solana_staking_is_tastier_with_marinade/h8eukyd/), get SOL back, transfer to FTX, then cash out. That is if I don't use FTX staking itself (it has issue of waiting for longer time to get funds back from unstaking).

Aside from [supplying mSOL to a lending protocol](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/r2e6pj/hello_this_is_my_first_post_here_as_i_recently/hm4ebiy/), [Render Network](https://rendertoken.com/) is interesting too. [Raydium](https://beta.raydium.io/) looks like a great DeFi platform. [NFToken](https://nftoken.so/) is [nice for minting NFTs](https://twitter.com/VictorPontis/status/1538982084080979969).

I don't hold much [cryptocurrencies](../../cryptocurrencies/cryptocurrencies.md) including SOL as I am still trying to understand how truly useful this technology is. Thus far I see a clear use case for [Monero](../../cryptocurrencies/monero.md) to buy things safely that [government does not allow for whatever archaic reasons](../../drugs/psychedelics/psychedelics.md). I think this space moves very fast though so maybe something truly groundbreaking comes along. Perhaps it's [micro transactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31386483) (currently not possible due to Mastercard/Visa monopoly on online transactions and their 3% fees).

## Notes

- [I don’t think Solana is at war with ETH or any other blockchain - our community is just focused on building stuff people want and will use. Please minimize the toxicity and let’s focus on utility not price.](https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1434304520050249731)
- [Can create a verifiable build for _any_ solana program via `anchor build --verifiable` and we have a (minimal) source verification registry at Anchor Project Serum](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante/status/1458490295708966918)
- [Arweave is just another historical copy. Consensus doesn't care about any history that is older than the epoch, so there is no liveness dependency on AR.](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1466535989963223041)
- [solana-py does websockets](https://twitter.com/dj_d_sol/status/1466417431409213450)
- You need to keep 0.02 SOL minimum to make a transaction. Best to keep ~ 0.1 SOL on the wallet.
