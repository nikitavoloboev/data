# [Blockchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

Blockchain is an [immutable linked list of hashes that uses some consensus system like proof of stake (or other methods) to decide which blocks (transactions or runnable code) are added next](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEGCF-WLh2RLOHv_xUGLqRts_9JxrckiA).

[Solana](solana.md), [Tezos](tezos.md), [Monero](../../cryptocurrencies/monero.md) & [Avalanche](../../cryptocurrencies/avalanche.md) are interesting blockchains. In future they can let you [run web apps that run like protocols -- no company in the middle, just peer to peer networks](https://twitter.com/samecwilliams/status/1466460819508453383). In practice now, they are [mostly empty promises and lots of fraud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g).

[You should not use a blockchain unless you critically need finality in a shared context with a lot of other financial applications like exchanges, stable coin providers. If you don't need that, don't use a blockchain.](https://youtu.be/35_rr8Vf-4k?t=27635)

[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) is a [unique game built on top of blockchain](https://twitter.com/larsiusprime/status/1537181872572485632).

## Consensus algorithms

- PoW: The more hashing power the more trust worthy.
- PoS: The more coins the more trust worthy.
- PBFT: Hand selected trusted nodes.
- Randomized asynchronous algorithm: You trust nobody! Every single node is constantly re-evaluated. ([Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net))

## Notes

- [As blockchain scalability gets better and better, and UX improves and fees drop as a result, this will become a bigger and bigger part of the story.](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1072158957999771648)
- [For any given file on the internet, it is unknowable now many NFTs might be pointing to it. So putting aside all the questions about what "ownership" actually means in this context (spoiler: almost nothing), it's not possible to know who owns a file just by looking at the file.](https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/1381616082868436992)
- [NFTs are being wash traded. That’s when the buyer and the seller are secretly the same person.](https://twitter.com/JWWeatherman_/status/1431373325842923527)
- [Keep L1 simple and decentralized and scale on L2.](https://twitter.com/latetot/status/1437794513389592587)
- [NFTs are a Ponzi scheme, corroborated by many reputable sources.](https://twitter.com/castpixel/status/1438063396772007937)
- [Person: web3 is empowering creators! Me: Oh so it's like a decentralized network like mastodon? Person: no it's like web 2.0 plus blockchain.](https://twitter.com/ReinH/status/1442536279409774597)
- [I would read an essay about how appeals to "community" in crypto have totally obscured power relations, governance, who makes money, and who's scamming who. This is an industry (wildly anarchic, unregulated, unequal, run by capital), not a community.](https://twitter.com/mims/status/1448253915976421376)
- [How NFTs can be used for money laundering: Someone pays "for the NFT" when they're actually paying for something illicit. Having the NFT can make it appear to be a legitimate transaction, so they can deposit the funds without the IRS losing their mind.](https://twitter.com/sageheroRC/status/1449020958463901702)
- [I believe what makes NFTs different is a transformative vision of a future that true believers find inspiring and achievable. In their eyes, the current speculative bubble is a mechanism for growing something enduring.](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1450886698951340033)
- [Recognizing the spiritual hunger that sits at the core of these movements (and remember how many in the space are young people!) is an important step to understanding them. Crypto culture is a mirror world that feeds off of the unexamined failures of the real world.](https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1450886210914709506)
- [One of the coolest things about crypto is being able to fork mainnet locally and just like...experiment with building on top of other peoples' contracts without hitting them. Such a mindset shift from web2. like you can turn the whole web into a staging environment. wild.](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1458553279562989571)
- [The only API you should trust is one controlled by a blockchain. Can’t be evil > don’t be evil. There’s key digital information (money, identity, digital assets, etc.) that users should have ultimate control of, and if this was trivially easy to access between apps, that would lead to vastly more innovation in software.](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1461723922336915459)
- [You can actually download all NFT images stored on sol/eth/tezos chains. Write software that will scan every block on any chain from genesis and if the links to an image (probably IPFS url), then download it to a directory. Do it for any chain and can do it continuously as a running program then create a gallery URL perhaps. Essentially build a web page in which images stored on chain are streamed and shown in real from different chains.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29290156)
- [Many people misunderstand NFTs as 'paying for access' because that's the only (direct) relationship money has had with digital media until now. ownership without gated access is a conceptual leap, but it's worth making.](https://twitter.com/jstn/status/1464207143934910468)
- [Study of 6.1M NFT trades finds a few folks at the center of the market. The top 10% of traders account for 85% of transactions & trade at least once 97% of all assets. 10% of buyer–seller pairs have the same volume as the remaining 90%.](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1465505077083389960)
- [Forget web3/blockchain/crypto/defi/buzz word. This is the "Community Computer" revolution. Personal Computers unleashed unimaginable levels of sovereignty & interoperability for people. Community Computers will do same for groups.](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1466092508316905478)
- [As a user of Web 3.0, all interactions will be carried out pseudonymously, securely and for many services, trustlessly.](https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1473419653896716288)
