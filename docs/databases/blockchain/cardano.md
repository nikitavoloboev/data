# [Cardano](https://cardano.org/)

Cardano appears to be a [project that didn't meet its goals](https://twitter.com/froggyfrogster/status/1433653091493195794) (especially when compared to [alternatives](../../cryptocurrencies/cryptocurrencies.md)). Research done by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/en/research/) is interesting though.

## Notes

- [Cardano appears to be a trap for moderately smart people who don’t have time to read cryptocurrency whitepapers all day. Staking is nothing new, smart contracts are nothing new.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26005048)
