# Databases

Love using [EdgeDB](edgedb.md) for all my db needs (builds on [Postgres](postgresql.md) & has [amazing query language](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/index) & [declarative schema modeling](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/datamodel/index)).

I use [SQlite](sqlite.md) for when I need an embedded database for my apps for local first architectures.

[Database Internals](https://www.databass.dev/) & [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) are great books on databases.

[Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) is a great SQL queries visualizer. [Database access optimization doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/optimization/) is a good read.

[Ditto](https://www.ditto.live/), [Replicache](https://replicache.dev/) & [Tuple Database](https://github.com/ccorcos/tuple-database) are fascinating tools for for [syncing local state for fast network bound operations](https://twitter.com/maccaw/status/1528848433968209923) using [CRDTs](../distributed-systems/crdt.md) and other tools. [PlanetScale](planetscale.md) seems awesome too.

## Notes

- [Database queries are especially fast if you copy the database into RAM.](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1380240448606756865)
- [More than likely images/videos are stored in something like AWS S3 and the database would just have links to them. It is possible to store an image straight up in a database though but it would be as a blob/buffer data that is then turned back into an image on the client. The blob/base64 string way can be slower/probably not recommended. For fast load/performance they'd use caching/cdn.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/moj0rb/how_do_websites_store_videos_and_images_can_this/)
