# Keyboards

I love keyboards. Specifically I love remapping them with [Karabiner](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) to extend them to do more awesome things for me.

I am currently using builtin MacBook keyboard and love it. I love the low key travel as I get tired typing on most mechanical keyboards.
