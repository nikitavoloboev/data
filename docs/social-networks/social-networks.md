# Social networks

[How to run a small social network site for your friends](https://runyourown.social/) is a neat guide.

## Notes

- [Facebook has recruited one of the world’s top AI teams, led by Yann LeCun. Their work and Google's are the equivalent of tobacco companies engineering cigarettes to ensure that nicotine hits a smoker's brain more quickly. Facebook and other social networks are the cigarette companies of the mind. Cigarettes blackened our lungs with tar, and social media blacken our brains with distraction, alienation, envy, and loneliness.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15421704)
  - Social media networks will become ever more addictive, and by using AI to increase the click-through rate on the ads, they will squeeze ever more money out of their addicts. AI will be essential to the "capture and sale of attention," as Tim Wu puts it, walking users from curiosity to the cash register more and more efficiently.
  - Capitalism is an accelerant for addictive behavior, and we are only just realizing how unhappy people become as a result of the marketplace’s newest and most insidious products. What's worse, the necessary functions performed by our phones and the Internet are fatefully tangled with the apps that addict us. They put the heroin next to the tap water.
- [FB simply prolonged relationships that should’ve died out a long time ago naturally](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7lsywl/people_who_have_deleted_social_media_like/droyc6d/ "permalink")
  - Generally you'd lose contact with all these people over time as you mature and just naturally drift apart. No shame in that, the ones you do want to keep in touch with you'd make a real effort for. Now it's so easy to just send a "like" , "congratulations!" or "Happy birthday!" that you find yourself very loosely connected to a bunch of people you don't want to be but feel like everyone else is still in "contact" so you don't want to miss out.
- When you realize that Instagram is someones curated life, you realize how manufactured their profile actually is. What you see is what they want you to see.
- [The sad truth is that friendly face isn’t Facebook’s true face; it’s a sham, just like it’s a sham to sit on a tractor so people will think you’re tall. Mark Zuckerberg uses your most intimate connections, the literal faces of the people you love, to fool you into thinking that he’s not picking your pocket and taking a wrecking ball to our media, to the integrity of our society, and to democracy itself.](https://medium.com/s/story/the-smallness-of-mark-zuckerberg-4e94a88bba02)
- [I gained a following in part because developers with larger followings would share my work. If you have a large following I highly encourage you to share the work of other creators! It costs nothing to share a blog or video but can make a huge difference to that creator!](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1379813903417364485)
- [Moderating a community is not censorship.](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama/status/1381145203113930753)
- [Facebook knew its algorithm incentivized outrage. Instagram knew it hurt teen girls. Facebook has been shielding VIPs from moderation.](https://twitter.com/JoshConstine/status/1438604572419756034)
- [The thing people don't see is that the problem isn't centralization, it's social media. Your decentralized social media will still be social media.](https://twitter.com/pvh/status/1445156784885297157)
- [I wonder how much any Facebook story now changes anyone's minds. There’s a group of people now quite convinced that Facebook is evil, who see any new story as proof, and the rest of us, who think it's all just a noisy mess. But what would change look like?](https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1445445611415736334)
- [FB (and social media generally) is amplifying the flaws in the human condition.](https://twitter.com/fugueish/status/1445584410376503299)
- [The main benefit of taking a break from social media is that you stop living in a fictional world and finally start dealing with your own reality.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29149961)
- [Instead of asking “how will you make money?” Or with NFTs “how much money are you making right now buying and selling into the hype?”, please ask “how does this lead to deep habitual usage?”](https://twitter.com/joshelman/status/1458466576449953799)
