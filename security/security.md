# Security
I use [1Password](https://1password.com/) password manager for saving all my passwords, various other credentials and private notes and it has been a life savour thus far. Having a unique password for all my accounts and using 2FA wherever available means I should be quite safe in case any of my accounts gets breached or the password gets leaked.
