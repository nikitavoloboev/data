# [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)
Pretty amazing search engine that respects user's privacy.

I especially like its [instant answers](https://duckduckgo.com/api) feature.

## Awesome instant answers
- `tldr` -  Give [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) summary of command. i.e. [tldr python](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tldr+python+r%3Aus&ia=software)

## Notes
- Can use `!ducky cats` will grab the first link for `cats` from search engine and open it.
