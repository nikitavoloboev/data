# DuckDuckGo
Pretty amazing search engine that respects user's privacy.

I especially like its [instant answers](https://duckduckgo.com/api) feature.

## awesome instant answers

- it has `tldr` integrated
	- so you can search for `tldr python` and it gives you a short summary of the command
	- there's also [explain shell](https://explainshell.com) for a more detailed overview
