# [GitHub](https://github.com)
I 💚 GitHub. It is really one of the best communities out there that exists with so many different projects and ideas being worked on at any given time.

I publish most of my work and make it open source for other people to use and reuse.

[Here](../sharing/my-github.md) you can find all the repositories I have shared.

## Issues
For managing my GitHub issues, I use [Ship macOS app](https://www.realartists.com).

It allows me to put certain issues into Up Next group as can be seen below:

And then I can go through these issues one by one.

## Notes
- You can append `#readme` to GitHub repo URL to jump to the README of the repo. I use it all the time for curated lists of any kind and where README is the most important thing in the repo.
- Selecting some text in a github comment and pressing `r` will make a reply of that text.
- [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump) workflow is one of the best things you can install to navigate GitHub like a God.
	- I [slightly modified it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows#workflow-augmentations) to jump to different parts of the repo with modifiers like going to issues, releases, opening new issue or even cloning the repo instantly.
- I can include media files like GIFs in the repository itself and then just reference them from readme to embed them.
- I can include and mix in HTML in GitHub readme's. This is super useful for embedding images because you can customise `width` and `height` values to make the READMEs look a lot nice.
- I can tack in various GitHub related templates like `issue_template.md` and `pull_request_template.md` as well as `code_of_conduct.md` and even `contributing.md` under `.github` folder at the root of my project.
