# GitHub
I 💚 GitHub. It is really one of the best communities out there that exists with so many different projects and ideas being worked on at any given time.

I publish most of my work and make it open source for other people to use and reuse and I build my own system to how I can be productive using the GitHub website and all the tooling and services it provides.

[Here](https://my.mindnode.com/ZKGETDkUaQUsL3q8q9z788CxG84oEHgDiT79GuzX#-143.5,-902.6,0) you can find all the repositories I have shared. 

## Issues
For managing issues I have, I use [Ship macOS app](https://www.realartists.com).

It allows me to put certain issues into Up Next group as can be seen below :

And then I can go through these issues one by one.

## Tips and Tricks
- selecting some text in a github comment and pressing `r` will make a reply of that text
- [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump) workflow is one of the best things you can install to navigate GitHub like a God
	- I [slightly modified it](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3iyjt3pyuz8mup/github%20jumps-.alfredworkflow?dl=1) to jump to different parts of the repo with modifiers like going to issues, releases, opening new issue or even cloning the repo instantly
- [this](http://www.somsubhra.com/github-release-stats/) is really cool website where you can find how people people have downloaded various GitHub releases of people
- I can include media files like GIFs in the repository itself and then just reference them from README to embed them
	- media folder is usually used for this
- I can include and mix in HTML in GitHub readme's
	- this is super useful for embedding images because you can customise `width` and `height` values to make the READMEs look a lot nicer
