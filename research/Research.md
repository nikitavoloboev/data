# Research

Research is an interesting topic and something that plays a big role in my life. I like to think that I do research every day.

# How I do research

The most useful thing that has helped me be more productive in uncovering new and interesting things is to do things with a purpose. Research included.

As for the research itself, I use all the tools available to me to answer a question I have. I love using [macOS dictionary app](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dictionary_(software)) to quickly go and read a wiki article. It is amazing how fast it lets me both search for things there and simply explore the depth of the wiki.

For searching, I use :

- Google
	- general / programming related
- DuckDuckGo
	- private searches / instant answers / cheat sheets
- GitHub
	- software / repos / code search

And of course I love specialising my search to any website I wish. My [Web Searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) workflows lets me do that with ease and anyone can download it too to get all these search super powers. 

There is also absolutely amazing workflow to [search various websites with autosuggestions](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-searchio). I highly recommend it. It essentially lets you have powerful search like Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube and more from wherever you are in your operating system. It is really fast.
