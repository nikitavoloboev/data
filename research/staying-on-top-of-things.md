# Staying on top of things
There is so much out there in the world. It's often really hard to stay on top of things and many times not being able to understand something is frustrating so is feeling as if you are _missing out_.

Of course, it is all in my head and [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) is the answer. But I still want to do my best and try and understand as many things as I can because knowing a broad range of things helps me connect the dots and pieces together faster.

I use [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) macOS app to completely block many websites with constantly updated feeds like front page of Hacker News, GitHub, Reddit and more. I automatically run Focus every 2 hours for 90 minutes and work throughout this period fully focused. After that time, I review what I have done in [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) and I have 30 minutes to check the news and view usually blocked websites and after that, the timer starts again.

## What I use
I try to stay in touch using these few things:

### RSS with [Reeder](../macOS/apps/reeder.md)
I follow [blogs I like](blogs.md) and read them through them with [Reeder](../macOS/apps/reeder.md) which I occasionally check to see what's new.

### [Hacker News](https://hckrnews.com/) and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)
They are my two favourite news aggregators on the web. I like lobsters for its smaller community and quite often better links and discussions.

### Twitter with [Tweetbot](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md)
Twitter is my favourite social media network and it is where I share everything [I am personally up to](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) right now. I love Twitter for its ability to tailor completely what news and tweets I am actually reading. I never check the official Twitter page. I only view [the lists I made](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists). I split my Tweetbot into [four columns](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md) and the app is always full screen although during __Focus__ session, the app is inaccesible to me, I can only post tweets.

### Reddit
My Reddit is heavily tailored to my own likes and I very often just look into some subreddits I like to see what is new. I list subreddits I like [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/reddit#readme). I also really love using and creating [multi reddits](https://github.com/learn-anything/reddit-multi) I often check out.

I access all these subreddits from my [Alfred Learn Anything](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) and [Deanishe's Reddit worklfow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-reddit) workflows.

### IRC
I love using IRC and hanging out in various channels of Freenode. Mostly as a way to get help with an issue that I can't solve on my own after searching for everything.

### [Pinboard (popular)](https://pinboard.in/popular/)
I sometimes check it out as it does contain some interesting links.

## Medium
I follow few publications and writers on Medium. I then view new articles from my feed [here](https://medium.com/stream/network).

## Communities and forums I frequent
I spend a lot of my time in the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/learn-anything/Lobby) chat to discuss Learn Anything development.

Aside from that I like visiting and at times contributing to these forums:
1. [Alfred forum](https://www.alfredforum.com)
2. [Keyboard maestro forum](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/latest)
3. [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/)

As well as quite a few other Slack communities like:
1. [Gophers](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
2. [ZEIT chat](https://zeit.chat)
3. [VS Code Vim](https://vscodevim-slackin.azurewebsites.net/)

- [News](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) - I wrote briefly my opinion about consuming news and media. Although my opinion as stated in the article is still the same. My approach as indicated above has changed and hopefully became a bit more refined to meet my own goals.
