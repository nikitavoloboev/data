# Staying on top of things

There is so much out there in the world. It's often hard to stay on top of things and many times not being able to understand something is frustrating so is feeling as if you are _missing out_.

Of course, it is all in my head and [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) is the answer. But I still want to do my best and try and understand as many things as I can because knowing a broad range of things helps me connect the dots and pieces together faster.

I use [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com) to send links I can't read right now from my phone/mac. It's an inbox of links I want to read through. High priority links/notes are sent as messages to myself on Telegram.

## What I use

I try to stay in touch using these few things:

### Twitter with [Tweetbot](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md)

Twitter is my favorite social media network and it is where I share everything [I am personally up to](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) right now. I love Twitter for its ability to tailor completely what news and tweets I am actually reading. I split Tweetbot into [two columns](../macOS/apps/tweetbot.md). I have two feeds, one with my top subs and everything else in [other list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1131319788012285952).

### [Hacker News](https://hckrnews.com/) and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)

They are my two favorite news aggregators on the web. I like Lobsters for its smaller community and quite often better links and discussions.

### Reddit

My Reddit is heavily tailored to my own likes and I very often just look into some subreddits I like to see what is new.

Here is [multireddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/2DoApp+AdvancedFitness+AlanWatts+AskComputerScience+AskHistorians+AskMen+AskNetsec+AskProgramming+Automate+Bogleheads+CGPGrey+Clojure+Coffee+Compilers+Coq+CryptoTechnology+Cyberpunk_Music+Design+DrugNerds+Entrepreneur+EuropeFIRE+EveryLittleAnimation+EverythingScience+FIREUK+Fitness+Futurology+GonWildCurvy+GraphicsProgramming+HumanMicrobiome+Immunology+InternetIsBeautiful+Julia+LaTeX+Letterboxd+LoRaWAN+Lora+MLQuestions+MacOS+MachineLearning+Meditation+Microbiome+MusicForConcentration+Neuralink+NixOS+NoStupidQuestions+Nootropics+OutOfTheLoop+Pet_Renaissance+Physics+PlantBasedDiet+PostgreSQL+PourPainting+ProgrammerTIL+ProgrammingLanguages+PsychedelicStudies+Python+REMath+RISCV+Racket+RationalPsychonaut+ReverseEngineering+Showerthoughts+SiriShortcuts+SoftwareEngineering+SublimeText+SwiftUI+TheeHive+TrueFilm+UKInvesting+UKPersonalFinance+WeAreTheMusicMakers+WireGuard+ZeroWaste+agda+algorithms+ambientmusic+analog+apljk+apolloapp+apple+artificial+askdrugs+askscience+aws+bioinformatics+blog+boardgames+bodyweightfitness+cardano+chan+coding+cogsci+compsci+computerscience+cpp+csbooks+cscareerquestions+cscareerquestionsEU+darknetplan+dataisbeautiful+datascience+dependent_types+devops+elixir+elm+embedded+erlang+ethereum+europe+explainlikeimfive+explorables+fatFIRE+financialindependence+genetics+getdisciplined+golang+gonwild+haskell+history+homeautomation+iOSProgramming+investing+iosdev+javascript+kubernetes+leangains+learnanythingxyz+learnart+learnmachinelearning+learnprogramming+lectures+lisp+listentothis+longevity+macosprogramming+macprogramming+math+mathbooks+mildlyinteresting+minimalism+neuro+neuroscience+nextjs+nutrition+ocaml+osdev+photocritique+photography+privacy+programming+programmingtools+pytorch+reactjs+reactnative+reasonml+reinforcementlearning+rust+scala+science+selfhosted+shittychangelog+shortcuts+singularity+solotravel+spacex+startups+statistics+swift+sysadmin+tinycode+triphop+types+typescript+u_BluePinkGrey+u_Borax+u_ChristoferK+u_Cindori+u_CompuIves+u_DizzyEwok+u_DontStealStories+u_ElvishJerricco+u_LunarStone+u_Odersky+u_SrPeixinho+u_StingrayZ+u__philpl+u_algernone+u_caliform+u_cmsj+u_deanishe+u_desiringmachines+u_dlgn13+u_edwardkmett+u_emersion_fr+u_isovector+u_jamesknelson+u_japaric+u_jerf+u_k0001+u_karlicoss+u_kennethreitz+u_majid8+u_mittsh+u_mstoiber+u_nat_friedman+u_nglgzz+u_notoriousrdc+u_nrinaudo+u_nullc+u_quchen+u_robpike+u_rperciav+u_rvolosatovs+u_sfvisser+u_sobolevn+u_sobri909+u_spez+u_spladug+u_swyx+u_tazjin+u_terrorjack+u_tiss93+u_tuhdo+u_uhoreg+userexperience+veganfitness+veganketo+videography+vim+vim_magic+vscode+web_design+webdev+zeronet/) of subreddits I am subbed too. Less priority subs are put in [Other list](https://www.reddit.com/user/nikivi/m/other).

There is also nice [list of Reddit subs](https://github.com/learn-anything/reddit#readme). I access all these subreddits using [Deanishe's Reddit worklfow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-reddit#readme).

### RSS with [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/)

I follow [blogs I like](blogs.md) and read them through them with Reeder.

### IRC

I love using IRC with [Textual client](../macOS/apps/textual.md) and hanging out in various channels of Freenode. Mostly as a way to get help with an issue that I can't solve on my own after searching for everything.

### [Pinboard (popular)](https://pinboard.in/popular/)

I sometimes check it out as it does contain some interesting links.

### Medium

I follow few publications and writers on Medium. I then view new articles from my feed [here](https://medium.com/stream/network).
