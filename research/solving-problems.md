# Solving problems
Knowledge is knowing where the answers might lie. Solving problems is knowing how to apply the knowledge you have to solve a thing.

I like to be methodical when approaching and solving problems I have. 

For me solving a problem usually involves going through these three steps: 

1. Finding what the problem I want to solve is.
2. Finding an answer for said problem.
3. Solving the problem.

## 1. Finding what the problem is
I use one [MindNode](../macOS/apps/Mindnode.md) mind map called `thinking` where as a main node I outline the problem I want to solve and then I outline the steps I think I need to do to solve the problem. For example, I wanted to make a markdown parser. I outlined the problem as follows:

And then I could simply try to go through each of the steps outlined and hopefully reach a working solution. Of course, things can and often change in the process as I find things I have missed or found better ways to do a thing but the idea and structure still stays.

# 2. Finding the answer
As mentioned in [research](./Research.md), I mostly use Google for searching mixed in with DuckDuckGo. I heavily use Dash for documentation and Dictionary for searching the wiki. I use IRC and various forums specific to the problem I am solving. 

I often remind myself of [how to effectively ask questions](./asking-questions.md) so as to respect other people's time and maximise chances of getting a good answer.

# 3. Solving the problem.
Sometimes I already know the answer given my past experience without conducting help outside and the only thing left is to apply the solution I have or have found. 

In some cases, a problem may be complex enough that it needs time thinking more about it. Researching various possible solutions and things you could use. And playing with possible solutions and ideas in your head until you reach something worthwhile you can spend time implementing.
