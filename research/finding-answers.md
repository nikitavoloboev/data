# Finding answers

Knowledge is knowing where the answers might lie. Solving problems is knowing how to apply the knowledge you have to solve a thing.

I like to be methodical when approaching and solving problems I have. 

As mentioned in [research](./Research.md), I mostly use Google for searching mixed in with DuckDuckGo. I heavily use Dash for documentation and Dictionary for searching the wiki. I use IRC and various forums specific to the problem I am solving. 

However the best thing I found that helps me is to really step down and thing at what it is I am trying to do and either mind map the problem or sketch it on a piece of paper.
