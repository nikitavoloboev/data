# Blogs
I use [Reeder](../macOS/apps/reeder.md) to stay on top of my favourite blogs I follow which I sync with [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) between phone and mac.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/f67d6d37a8c32fa6f86a23bd77107fbd) is my XML subscription feed of blogs I follow. And [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/following) is the list of people I follow on Medium.
