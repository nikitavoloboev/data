# Asking Questions

[This][1] has everything in it on how to ask questions correctly.

In short, it can be summed down to this : 

1. do your own research first
2. include things you have tried and thought of before asking the question
3. be explicit about what you want to achieve in the end and provide as much information as possible to help 
4. respect other people's time
