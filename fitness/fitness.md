I currently do daily bodyweight exercises in form of situps & pushups. I also do cardio exercise daily either by running, cycling or walking & I like to play football weekly.

I never sit for prolonged times & take breaks standing or walking around.

## Notes

- Exercise helps make better use of the foods you are eating and produces the hormones you need to think clearly.
- [It's been shown that the timing of your meals and more specifically your protein intake, doesn't make any difference to the growth of your muscles. Just get adequate protein and calories throughout the day, though you might want to eat something post workout anyway for energy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/9fxkof/if_you_eat_a_big_preworkout_meal_do_you_need_to/)
- [Massive calorie surplus isn't making you put on muscle any faster and is just being turned into fat. And that makes sense. There is only so much muscle you can actually build naturally every week/month/year. Extra calories beyond what will be used for that muscle growth aren't going to increase that limit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ed6kbi/thoughts_on_greg_doucette_and_his_opinion_on/)
