# Fitness

I start every morning by either going to the gym, playing tennis or running for 1 hour.

I am also limiting my time being stationary and never sitting in one place for too long.

## Notes

- Exercise helps make better use of the foods you are eating and produces the hormones you need to think clearly.
- [It's been shown that the timing of your meals and more specifically your protein intake, doesn't make any difference to the growth of your muscles. Just get adequate protein and calories throughout the day, though you might want to eat something post workout anyway for energy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/9fxkof/if_you_eat_a_big_preworkout_meal_do_you_need_to/)
