# iOS
My favourite mobile operating system mostly due to me not really trying anything else.

I wrote how I use iOS in quite a bit of detail [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios) alongside all the different apps I use on it.

I hope to release Learn Anything on iOS soon too. That would be quite cool.
