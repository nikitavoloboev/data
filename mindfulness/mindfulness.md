# Mindfulness

If I ever want to master one thing in life, mindfulness would be it.

I [wrote briefly](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/the-root-of-it-all-9b6ab6a77e1d) about how I think of learning and gaining new skills in life as climbing a tree. And how each skill or thing you learn has a tree of dependencies leading up to it. Well, I found that if you think about this, then mindfulness is really the culprit of all the optimizations you want to do in your life. You may have good intentions and perhaps have a pretty good plan, but if you don't follow through, all of that is lost. And mindfulness and being aware of what it is you are doing is needed to make that happen.

I wrote more of my thoughts on mindfulness [here](meditation.md). I learned a lot about mindfulness and life from [Alan Watts](../humans/alan-watts.md).

## Notes

- [Stanislav Grof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Grof), [Ajahn Chah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Chah), Rupert Spira are interesting.
- [It’s being mindful and living in the present moment. Not worried about the future or the past. Also, the goal of meditation is not to quit having thoughts, but to observe them, watch them without reacting and rationalizing them. This helps rewire the way your brain works similar to cognitive behavioral therapy. Typically, people who work towards this, have less anxiety and depression because they don’t react to every thought they have, which gives them a greater control of their emotions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/fsjp6s/in_the_psychedelic_community_its_insinuated_that/)
