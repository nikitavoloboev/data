# Productivity

My personal productivity is very important to me. And I always try to find things that work best for myself and maximise it. I also try to track and quantify my own productivity using various tools.

My biggest rule I try to follow is to live by my 2Do task manager. And work through tasks I have assigned one by one where each task has an estimate attached to it in form of a tag. Like so :

I then use [EggTimer workflow](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/275-eggtimer-v2-updated-to-20-final/?tab=comments#comment-1117) to run the timer. And I activate [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) and work.

I also stopped using external monitors and only use one screen as I found multiple monitors to be a distraction for me.
