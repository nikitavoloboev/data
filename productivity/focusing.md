# Focusing
Focusing on the things I need to be doing is quite hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

My main goal with focusing is reaching the [state of flow](flow/flow.md) as soon as possible and keeping it for as long as possible throughout the day.

## Things that help me
- I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) to block a particular set of websites for 90 minutes (front pages of Hacker News, Reddit, ..).
- And I like to listen to some stimulating music. Lately been enjoying listening to [this](spotify:user:nikitavoloboev:playlist:0epiRzQHjdJieYr0y3TdST).
- Working outside from home and changing location often is also something helps me a lot in being productive.
- I also realised that multiple monitors is not so helpful for me after all and I am quite productive with just a macbook.
- I also try to [live by my calendar](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md). That is I try to assign blocks of time where I work on certain things and actually follow through and work during these time blocks. There is always something useful that I can be doing and I don't want to waste any mental energy choosing what to do in the moment.
