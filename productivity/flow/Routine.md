# Routine
Repeat things often enough and it becomes a routine. It's useful to be mindful and know what bad habits and routines you possess and break out of them. 

I hope to cultivate and make many healthy routines and habits throughout my life. Here is a start. It simply states thing I should ideally follow or do at any given time throughout the day / week.
