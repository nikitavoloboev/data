# Flow processes
Here are some of my [above described flow processes](./Flow.md) that I try to map for myself. Most I keep privately but others I don't mind sharing as I am using them myself.

## releasing workflows with OneUpdater
- don't forget to update version number and then also commit the workflow so info.plist on GitHub has the latest version

## research
- have pen and paper always with me

## making Anki cards
- don't make a card of a fact or something that you can easily look up
