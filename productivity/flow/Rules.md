# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## Git
- do atomic commits and write proper appropriate commit messages

## Markdown
- don't leave whitespace between headings and text
- headings should start with capital letter
	- code snippets headings don't have to

## GitHub
- GitHub descriptions should be capitalised 
- add appropriate topics to each repo
- if the readme is long enough, add a table of contents
- don't add anything that is not needed and focus on the content
- add image or logo if possible to visually show the workfow/library in action

## Alfred
- name triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased)

## Wiki
 - only add snippets of code that are really useful
	- keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only
- Heading should always be on one level heading
	- and Snippets / Notes / Links / on two level heading
	- everything else on three levels where appropriate
- no TODOs in normal wiki entries
	- the wiki is for notes and references and some actionable dedicated lists like [reading](../working-on/Reading.md) or [learning](../working-on/Learning.md).

## Writing
- capitalise things properly
