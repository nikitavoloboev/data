# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## Wiki
 - Only add snippets of code that are really useful
	- keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only
- Heading should always be on one level heading
	- and Snippets / Notes / Links / on two level heading
	- everything else on three levels where appropriate
- No TODOs in normal wiki entries
	- the wiki is for notes and references and some actionable dedicated lists like [reading](../working-on/Reading.md) or [learning](../working-on/Learning.md).
- Describe links on the same line with `:` separator (if needs more description, then sub dash)

## Capitalising things
- Main dashed points
	- sub dash points (like this one) don't have to be capitalised
- Headings
- GitHub descriptions
- All GitHub issues and PRs
- Nodes in my mind
- Alfred workflows 

## Git
- Do atomic commits and write proper appropriate commit messages

## Karabiner
- Document any changes I make in Karabiner map instantly in the map (update where necessary)

## Markdown
- Don't leave whitespace between headings and text

## GitHub
- Add appropriate topics to each repo
- Add appropriate _quote_ to briefly describe the repo (often is the same as description but with links)
- If the readme is long enough, add a table of contents
- Don't add anything that is not needed and focus on the content
- Add image or logo if possible to visually show the workfow/library in action

## Alfred
- Name triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased)
- Name all modifier connections

## MindNode
- Use lighter themes for sharing (it's nicer) (and using in general)
- Use one tree structure for organisation especially when sharing maps (makes the map much easier to follow)

## Writing
- Use proper punctuation and capitalise things appropriately

## Social Networks
- Only add people I really know on Facebook

## Sharing files
- more permanent shares are shared with Dropbox
	-  don't delete items from `shares` folder unless I delete the file somewhere myself
- temporary shares with [Transfer](https://transfer.sh)
 - if the files are stored on GitHub somewhere, I can use [this](http://rawgit.com/) to get a downloadable link of the raw file

## Releasing workflows with OneUpdater
- don't forget to update version number and then also commit the workflow so info.plist on GitHub has the latest version

## Research
- have pen and paper always with me

## Making Anki cards
- don't make a card of a fact or something that you can easily look up

## Working
- work to complete the task I have at hand
- turn on [Focus block](https://heyfocus.com) when working and never visit any news sites or discussion forums
- live by my calendar 
	- assign tasks and blocks of time in advance and work through each of the blocks
	- adjust when necessary

## SnippetsLab
- upload all non sensitive snippets as Gists
- include all useful snippets in this wiki and add `wiki` tag
	- if I delete a snippet with `wiki` tag, delete it from wiki too
- create smart group for each new prefix I add
- add correct language syntax to every snippet

## Planning
- plan the next day in advance in the calendar
	- plan deadlines one week in advance
	- follow through with the plan but adapt where necessary

## My Mind
- uppercase entries in the main map + articles / GitHub + notes

## 2Do
- only contain things I really need to get done in `Today`
