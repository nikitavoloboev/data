# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## Ulysses
- don't leave whitespace between headings and text
- headings should start with capital letter
	- code snippets headings don't have to
- snippets of code headings should be on three level heading

## Alfred
- name triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased)

## GitHub
- centre headings in readme's and add badges below
	- add a logo or something visual if possible

## Wiki
 - only add snippets of code that are really useful
	- keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only
- Heading / Snippets / Notes / Links / should always be on one level heading
- no TODOs in normal wiki entries
	- the wiki is for notes and references and some actionable dedicated lists like [reading](../working-on/Reading.md) or [working on](../working-on/working-on.md)
