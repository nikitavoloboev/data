# Flow
Getting in the _flow_ is one of the most important things I try to focus on throughout the day.

The _flow_ state is different for all people. For myself I try to define it clearly. I also try to define a certain set of [rules](./Rules.md) and [processes](./flow-processes.md) that I like myself to follow for doing certain things.

For example, one of these _rules_ can be that I need to be proactive with my email. And strive to reach inbox zero until the end of the day. But there are many other ones out there. Essentially these _rules_ act as my own __predefined habits__ that I like to follow as a __response to some cue__.
