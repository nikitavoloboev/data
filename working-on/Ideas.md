# Ideas
Until I have built [Crafting Ideas](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas), I may put some of my ideas I have here although I really should just sit down and build the project. It solves a __huge__ problem of mine.

# workflows
- parse all [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and read from Alfred
- make LA workflow using our API
- parse all books from [free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) to Alfred
- index twitter following similar to [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump)
	- see if there is API for that
- alfred travis interface
	- quickly scan my builds and get info on them
	- 
# fun
- create a fractal tree
