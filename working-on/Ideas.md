# Ideas
Until I have built [Crafting Ideas](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas), I may put some of my ideas I have here although I really should just sit down and build the project. It solves a __huge__ problem of mine.

Feel free to _steal_ and make any of them yourself. Ideas with 🍀 are ideas I am working on at this moment.

## Alfred Workflows
- [Parse all awesome lists and read from Alfred](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-awesome-lists) 🍀
- Index people I follow on GitHub for fast search 🍀
- Parse all books from [free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) to Alfred
- Index starred Gists and store in sqlite to read from Alfred 
- Index twitter following similar to [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump)
	- see if there is API for that
- Alfred travis interface
	- quickly scan my builds and get info on them
- Parse arbitrary CSV files
	- similar to my [alfred edit files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-edit-files) but instead of it reading one file, you pass in some CSV file instead and it will parse it to show in Alfred
		- can use that for many things
- Quickly search through my entire Pixave library
- Workflow like [Safari Assistant](https://git.deanishe.net/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant) but for Chrome
- Search through all my Facebook friends (if there is API for that)
- Workflow to search through Product Hunt collections (if there is API)
- Make a more robust version of [EggTimer](http://www.packal.org/workflow/eggtimer-2) workflow 
- Search through all languages and open their trending page (if there is API)
	- and with modifiers scope the search (today/week/month)
- List all top artists I have listened to in this week/month from last.fm
- Date calculator
	- I type `7 march` and it shows me days until `7th of march`
- Create workflow wrapper over [OSStatus](https://www.osstatus.com/search/results?platform=all&framework=all&search=-600)
- Give a workflow a date and it tells you the time passed since the date
- Create a [Repl.io](https://repl.it) REPL of selected text and open a link with it
	- i.e. select some python code in an editor and it will pass that code into a REPL
- Search Godoc from Alfred with autosuggestions (if there is API)
- Save some GitHub topics tags into Sqlite for fast access similar to [this](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo/blob/master/update/github.go)

## Web
- [Your life as little boxes](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/boxes)
	- a little website to show your life as little boxes 
	- in similar vein to [Alfred time](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-time) but visualise time passed and time passing
	- although it would be cool to extend this idea further and make these little blocks of time actionable in some way
		- or even make boxes represent something else and not time (like habits done)
- [Website to create custom learning paths for anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/path-picker)
	- a simple website with a search bar and a todo like list where the search bar searches over all the different topics you can learn about and users can create _recipes_ for learning anything they wish to learn about
		- i.e. one can make a _recipe_ to learn React.js that includes Javascript, then HTML or one can make a recipe to learn machine learning that includes linear algebra and then statistics where both of those topics can be split into more topics
		- and then you can share these _recipes_ with other people where the goal is to show what you think is the _most efficient_ path to learning some topic is 
		- and others users can then go through that path and learn each of the topics in [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/)
