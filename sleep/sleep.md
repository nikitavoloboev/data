# Sleep

Sleeping is a way for our brains to flash out all the toxins that accumulated in the brain throughout the day. A kind of human garbage collector.

I [never limit my sleep and I try to sleep as much as my body needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsPgNuuS8pA) thus I wake up with no alarm.

I try to go to bed at the same time each day to maintain the Circadian rhythm.

## Notes

- [Consuming alcohol prior to sleep increases your avg sleeping heart rate by >10% because your liver is metabolizing alcohol and your body producing cortisol. You are forcing your heart to beat an extra 3k times during the night + getting lower sleep quality and lower recovery](https://twitter.com/m_franceschetti/status/1375867987614371840)
