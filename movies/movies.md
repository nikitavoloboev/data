# Movies
I really love watching interesting movies and I saw [a few of them](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/) thus far.

I love [making lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/) of movies I've seen and liked. Like a list of my [favourite movies](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/list/favourite) or a list of my [favourite movie directors](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/list/favourite-directors/) alongside my favourite movies from them.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jFaHJFow) and [Watchlist](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/watchlist/) of movies I want to watch.

And here are some [lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/lists/), [films](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/films/) and [reviews](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/reviews/) I liked.

## Movies seen
I track the movies I saw on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/) and I [review most movies](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/reviews/by/added/) I've seen.
