# Movies
I really love watching interesting movies and I have seen [quite a few of them](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/) thus far.

I love [making lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/) of movies I've seen and liked. Like a [list of my favourite movies](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/list/favourite-movies/).

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jFaHJFow) and [Watchlist](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/watchlist/) of movies I want to watch.

And here is a some [lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/lists/), [films](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/films/) and [reviews](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/reviews/) I liked.
