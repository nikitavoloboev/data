I use [regex101](https://regex101.com) every time I want write a new regex.

Small tip, [regex101](https://regex101.com) has night mode.

## Notes

- `.*` = will select all occurrences
- A regex is useful for validating simple patterns and for finding patterns in text. For anything beyond that it’s almost certainly a terrible choice.
