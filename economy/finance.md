# Finance

For my own personal finance, I budget all my money with my online bank app, [Monzo](https://monzo.com) and its Pots feature.

I have a `Save` pot that has a goal of 3000 pounds. The 3000 pound is the minimum amount I need to hold in order to be safe from any emergency spending.

I use [YNAB methodology](https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/) to proactively budget my finances. Monzo provides nice tools to budget money I want to spend by category.

Each transaction made with Monzo is automatically sorted into a category by the app. If that category is wrong, I correct it in the app.

I also use [N26](https://n26.com/en-gb/) bank in cases where I need Maestro card as Monzo only has MasterCard.

## Ongoing subscriptions

I use [Bobby](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bobby-track-subscriptions/id1059152023?mt=8) iOS app to track my ongoing subscriptions. I review it monthly on my scheduled monthly reviews and make sure I don't subscribe to any subscriptions that I find bring no value to my life or subscriptions that my budget doesn't allow to continue.

## Tracking what to buy next

I use [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) to track what things I want to buy next. These are just tasks with `buy` tag in 2Do sorted by priority. Here is how it looks:

## Notes

- FI is possible everywhere. The idea stays the same, save more than you spend, try generate passive income through stocks, dividends and property.
- [I think most people are going to mention credit cards in some way, but for me, it was how my actual bank accounts don't matter. It doesn't matter if I have $X in my savings and $Y in my checking account. I have $(X+Y) to budget and I need to budget $X for an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/908iob/what_was_the_hardest_part_of_ynab_for_you_to/)
  - Also, having $Z left over after budgeting doesn't mean I have $Z to blow. I have $Z to budget for next month since I already budgeted for my frivolous spending. That doesn't mean I don't just move $Z to something frivolous anyways.
- [It's a different way of thinking about budgeting. It's an envelope system. You have a pile of dollars (real dollars - these are all the dollars you own, right now, in your accounts), and a pile of envelopes. You begin stuffing dollar bills into envelopes - some into the bills coming due before you get paid again, some for groceries until you get paid again, some for gas until you get paid again, and with the smaller pile of dollars after those needs are taken care of, you begin to stuff dollars into your True Expenses - things like Car Maintenance, Insurance Payment, etc. When you run out of dollars, you STOP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/93l0gm/im_missing_something_here_possibly_a_brain/)
  - You stop, because you can't put imaginary dollars into envelopes.
  - YNAB is all about the now - about giving jobs to the money you have. Not to the money you might have later on. It is a different way of thinking, but once you make that mental shift, it comes clear and works beautifully.
