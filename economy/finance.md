# Finance

I manage my money with [N26](https://n26.com/en-gb/) (great in EU). When I lived in UK, [Monzo](https://monzo.com) was great.

I keep a minimum of 3,000 euro on the account at any time (to cover emergency spending + monthly bills). I budget the next month (make sure enough money is on main account for the month) as well as rebalance my [investment portfolio of stocks/ETFs/crypto](investing.md) (if necessary) at first Sunday of each month as part of a monthly [look back](../looking-back/looking-back.md). I also invest into [ideas that interest me](../ideas/ideas.md) & support open source projects & people I love.

I use a variation of [YNAB methodology](https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/) to somewhat mindfully manage my spending. I try to be mindful of more expensive things I buy try to never disregard spending on quality healthy food and essentials for my well being. Both N26 & Monzo track spending into categories and do a good job of it.

In future it would be nice to automate moving money to main account from less liquid assets I own quickly. FIAT tends to deprecate quickly so it's good idea to own hard assets (good ETFs being the safest investment).

## Ongoing subscriptions

I use [Bobby](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bobby-track-subscriptions/id1059152023?mt=8) iOS app to track my ongoing subscriptions. I review it monthly as part of my finance check up.

## Tracking what to buy next

I use [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) to track what things I want to buy next. These are just tasks with `buy` tag in 2Do sorted by priority. Here is how it looks:

## Notes

- FI is possible everywhere. The idea stays the same, save more than you spend, try generate passive income through stocks, dividends and property.
- [I think most people are going to mention credit cards in some way, but for me, it was how my actual bank accounts don't matter. It doesn't matter if I have $X in my savings and $Y in my checking account. I have $(X+Y) to budget and I need to budget $X for an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/908iob/what_was_the_hardest_part_of_ynab_for_you_to/)
  - Also, having $Z left over after budgeting doesn't mean I have $Z to blow. I have $Z to budget for next month since I already budgeted for my frivolous spending. That doesn't mean I don't just move $Z to something frivolous anyways.
- [It's a different way of thinking about budgeting. It's an envelope system. You have a pile of dollars (real dollars - these are all the dollars you own, right now, in your accounts), and a pile of envelopes. You begin stuffing dollar bills into envelopes - some into the bills coming due before you get paid again, some for groceries until you get paid again, some for gas until you get paid again, and with the smaller pile of dollars after those needs are taken care of, you begin to stuff dollars into your True Expenses - things like Car Maintenance, Insurance Payment, etc. When you run out of dollars, you STOP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/93l0gm/im_missing_something_here_possibly_a_brain/)
  - You stop, because you can't put imaginary dollars into envelopes.
  - YNAB is all about the now - about giving jobs to the money you have. Not to the money you might have later on. It is a different way of thinking, but once you make that mental shift, it comes clear and works beautifully.
- [Invoiced has great invoice generator.](https://invoice-generator.com/#/1)
- [IBKR trades currency for you on the actual market at whatever price it's currently trading. No fee. Perfect for exchanging FIAT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/qswoo3/exchange_400k_usd_to_eur/)
