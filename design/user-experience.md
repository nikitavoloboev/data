## Notes

- Like how [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) does the hamburger menu on mobile.
- [Underappreciated competitive advantage: letting people do x without creating an account.](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1261976515408990208)
- Love how both Apple & [Linear](https://linear.app/release-2020-12) present features in neat boxes on a grid.
