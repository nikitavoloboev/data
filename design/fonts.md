# Fonts
My current favourite font for programming is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). I use it in VS Code, Sublime and iTerm.

I also really love using Monotype Sorts font. I use it for my IRC client and Ulysses. I find it much more pleasing to read than Fira Code.

And I keep the default San Francisco Apple's font for all everything else.
