# Computer vision

## Libraries

- [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) - Open Source Computer Vision Library.
- [Gluon CV Toolkit](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv) - Provides implementations of the sate-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models in computer vision.
- [Pythia](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pythia) - Modular framework for vision and language multimodal research. Built on top of PyTorch.
- [video-object-removal](https://github.com/zllrunning/video-object-removal) - Just draw a bounding box and you can remove the object you want to remove.
- [GoCV](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv) - Go package for computer vision using OpenCV 4 and beyond.
