# Learn Anything Future (April 2024)

Did talk in Russian for Yandex Open Source Jam as LA won Yandex open source grant. [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/live/6j4egX9eY9I?t=19263). [Slides](<LA%20slides%20in%20Russian%20(April%2024).pdf>).

Also initially did slides in English that can be seen [here](https://nikiv.dev/slides/la-april-24).

## Trying out Slidev

Rest of the content of the folder is me trying to make presentation work with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) instead of [Pitch](https://pitch.com/) but I dropped it after a point.

## Setup

```
bun i
```

## Run
