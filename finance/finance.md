# Finance
For my own personal finance, I budget all my money with [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com).

[YNAB ideology](https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/) methodology for managing money is extremely effective as it allows one to be be more proactive with budgeting and spending. It lets me know how much money I have and how much money I can spend on any given category. I find this proactive approach in dealing with money very freeing and powerful.

Below are the categories I use in YNAB:

I assign the budgets for the categories at the beginning of each month and am strict with adhering the budgets. If there is no budget for eating out, don't eat out.

Saving is just another category and I budget the money I have left after my budget towards saving for emergencies and bigger purchases.

## Notes
- FI is possible everywhere. The idea stays the same, save more than you spend, try generate passive income through stocks, dividends and property.
- [I think most people are going to mention credit cards in some way, but for me, it was how my actual bank accounts don't matter. It doesn't matter if I have $X in my savings and $Y in my checking account. I have $(X+Y) to budget and I need to budget $X for an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/908iob/what_was_the_hardest_part_of_ynab_for_you_to/)
	- Also, having $Z left over after budgeting doesn't mean I have $Z to blow. I have $Z to budget for next month since I already budgeted for my frivolous spending. That doesn't mean I don't just move $Z to something frivolous anyways.
