# My Workflow
I try to be methodical in working and doing things. And I use the best tools and workflows that work for me to achieve my goals.

## Life
- [Rules](../focusing/rules.md) - Grounds me into focusing on what I find important in life and cutting out the waste.
- [Processes](../focusing/processes.md) - Streamlines doing some tasks.

## Code
- [VS Code](../text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md) - Main editor. Currently write mostly Go and Python.
- [Sublime Text](../text-editors/sublime-text.md) - GitHub readmes, editing the wiki and quick edits (Markdown mostly).
- [Neovim](../text-editors/vim/vim.md) - Small and quick edits. Edit my Karabiner XML config file there.

## Task tracking
- [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) - Personal day-to-day tasks. Every task is actionable. Tasks that don't fit into a GitHub issue are put there. Usually this includes personal tasks.
- [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/index.html) - GitHub issues. All issues I want to work on soon are put into __Up Next__ queue and I work through each one, one by one.
- [Trello](../macOS/apps/trello.md) - Public and personal boards. It's really nice because I can share pragmatically things I want to do publically and have the workflow actually be seamless so it doesn't distract or detach from the experience in any way.

## Time management
- [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md) - I plan my work for the entire day ahead of me and my day is primarily guided by the events I create. I always have Fantastical show __Week__ view for __5 days__ from current day. This gives me a perspective on what deadlines I have soon to complete and I can adjust my events as necessary and plan accordingly.
- [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) - Track all time I spend there. I try to automate as much of the tracking as possible so Timing learns from what I do and it's easy to fill out the sections after.

## Knowledge Indexing
- [This wiki](../readme.md) - A bunch of markdown files rendered by [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) and edited with Ulysses and Sublime Text.
- Articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) - Share longer articles that serve to answer some one message or share some one insight there. This wiki is a more living and ever changing document.
- [SnippetsLab](../macOS/apps/snippetslab.md) - Snippets of code and knowledge (facts/reference).

## Bookmarks
- [Curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme) - I open any of the lists readmes in seconds and any edit I make is automatically commited with Hazel. The lists are open to contribution too this way they get better and scale with time.
- [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) -  All my public facing bookmarks. Searching this wiki here. Searching my articles, my GitHub repos and more.
- [Safari](../web/browsers/safari.md) and [Chrome](../web/browsers/google-chrome.md) bookmarks - Only contain personal bookmarks. The rest is publically available and queriable by anyone.

## Photographs
- [Pixave](../macOS/apps/pixave.md) - My entire media library of images and GIFs neatly sorted into collections. I post some images from there to my [Instagram page](https://instagram.com/prettiways).
- Apple Photos - All my personal photographs and images I made sorted into albums.
- [Day One](../macOS/apps/day-one.md) - Alongside small private notes and journal entries I add most photographs I take to Day One. Usually in form of __Travel__ checkins. It's really awesome because everything there is encrypted and I can rely on it always being there.

## Journalling
- [Day One](../macOS/apps/day-one.md) - All my private thoughts and journal entries.
- [Looking back](../looking-back/looking-back.md) - My public log of things I've done and worked on throughout the months with highglights and comments on each month/year.

## Writing
- [Ulysses](../macOS/apps/ulysses.md) - All my writing. Medium posts, stories, wiki, small pieces and ideas.

## Contacts
- Apple Contacts - All contacts and people I meet are added as contacts in my contacts book. All contacts are prefixed with a category (i.e. __f.__ for __friend__) and most contacts have tags attached so it's easier to remember the person. I also add various people I follow as contacts and use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/search-for-content#readme) to search all contacts, names, tags links and notes I wrote for the contact.
