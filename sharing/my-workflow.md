# My Workflow
I try to be methodical in working and doing things. And I use the best tools and workflows that work for me to achieve my goals.

## Life
- [Rules](../focusing/rules.md) - Grounds me into focusing on what I find important in life and cutting out the waste.
- [Processes](../focusing/processes.md) - Streamlines doing some tasks.
- [Habits](../focusing/habits.md) - Habits I am working towards and habits I've learned already.

## Code
- [VS Code](../text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md) - Main editor. Write mostly Go and TypeScript.
- [Sublime Text](../text-editors/sublime-text/sublime-text.md) - GitHub readmes, editing this wiki and quick edits.
- [Neovim](../text-editors/vim/vim.md) - Edit my [Karabiner](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) config file there.

## Task tracking
- [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) - Personal day-to-day tasks. Every task is actionable.
- [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/index.html) - GitHub issues. All issues I want to work on soon are put into __Up Next__ queue and I work through each one, one by one.
- [Trello](../macOS/apps/trello.md) - Public and personal boards used for different projects centered around my one [Focus](../focusing/focusing.md) board.

## Time management
- [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md) - I plan work for the entire day ahead and my day is primarily guided by the events I create. I use __Week__ view with __5 days__ from current day shown in the app. This gives me a perspective on what deadlines I have soon to complete and I can adjust my events as necessary and plan accordingly.
- [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) - Track all time I spend there. I automate as much of the tracking as possible so Timing learns from what I do and it's easy to fill out the sections after.

## Knowledge Indexing
- [This wiki](../readme.md) - A bunch of markdown files rendered by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and edited with Sublime Text.
- Articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) - Share longer articles on some one topic there. This wiki is a more living and ever changing document.
- [SnippetsLab](../macOS/apps/snippetslab.md) - Snippets of code shared with [GitHub Gists](my-gists.md).

## Bookmarks
- [Curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme) - Extension to [Awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme), serves as a way to publically curate valuable links on different topics and [search them](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything). Any change I make to the lists are automatially comitted with [Hazel](../macOS/apps/hazel.md).
- [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) -  All my public facing bookmarks. Searching this wiki here. Searching my articles, my GitHub repos and more.
- [Safari](../web/browsers/safari.md) - Only contains personal bookmarks I search with [Safari Assistant](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant). The rest is publically available and queriable by anyone.

## Photographs

- Apple Photos - All my personal photographs and images I made.

## Journalling
- [Day One](../macOS/apps/day-one.md) - All my private memories lie there. It also gets information from my Instagram/Twitter pages so I have nearly everything stored in one place which makes `On This Day` feature awesome.
