# Lessons learned
Things I have learned in life. To remind myself not to repeat the mistakes I have made.

## Life
- Prioritise.
	- Do the important things first.
	- Define these _important_ things for myself and be clear with what I want to achieve.
- Be consistent.
	- Define my own [rules](../productivity/flow/rules.md) and follow them. Adjust the rules and my workflow to match what I have learned.
- Do things that scale.
	- Try find solutions that will scale with time. Ideally try to come up with solutions to problems that don't just help I but help other people solve a problem.
- Don't repeat what other people have already done.
	- If possible reuse other people's work as much as possible to create new and novel things.
- Don't compare myself to other people.
- Make friends with imperfection.
	- Enjoy and cherish the process and never fixate on the result. Projects, articles, ideas will evolve with time and will never be what I first envisioned them to be. But I can only know that when I start and try make it.
- Just start.
	- Getting distracted is easy but starting is hard.
- Move fast.
	- Ask questions whenever I don’t understand. Don’t sit idly. Try things to see if they work. If they fail, move on.
- Think long term.
	- What do I ultimately want to achieve or want to exist in the world.
- Focus.
	- Focus is the ability to say __no__ to things.
- Study smart.
	- Ask myself the question of what it is I am trying to solve or understand. Start working to solve the problems before the deadline. And __prioritise__.
- Do one thing at a time.
	- Rather than trying to achieve all of my goals at once, it's best focus on completing one thing at a time. Sometimes external pressure can make this hard, but try to stick to it as much as possible. I've found that it enables me to move way faster.
- Write more.
	- Document my thoughts and findings and share it. Research really well the topic I am trying to share. Make sure I don’t repeat what has been said before and if it was. Link to it and make my own observations and conclusions.
- Remove friction.
	- In whatever I am doing, try to remove as much friction as possible.
	- Try to practice self documentation. For example don't try to to map things in one app and then try to outline the mappings in another. Try to make the process self documenting and remove the friction of going and keeping the documentation up-to-date. Only do it where it is really necessary and helpful.
- Track my expenses.
- Get into the [flow state](../productivity/flow/flow.md) as early as possible during the day.
- Just being exposed to concepts through videos or tutorials is not going to help me pass interviews.
	- Actually code everything up and implement it.
- Don’t be careless on the exams and when doing exercises.
	- Check back on my work and go through my calculations. It is very easy to miss something.
- Sit up right.
	- My body language dictates how I feel. Sit straight and don’t slouch my back.
- Drink water.
	- Always stay hydrated.
- Pay attention to my health and well being.
	- Do not consume excess sugar.
- Learn by investigation.
	- Rather than by consuming some data points.
	- That is __strive to understand__.
		- Why?
		- And how?
- Use paper.
	- Don’t be full digital and try out my calculations and thinking on paper.
- Read documentation.
	- It saves a lot of time.
- Keep receipts of expensive purchases.
	- I never know what happens and a lot of more expensive items have warranty.
- Specialise.
	- Don’t jump at everything and try to know it all.
	- Be really great at one thing and then I can branch out.
- Check everything once I leave a room.
	- Did I forget anything?
- Learn from my mistakes.
	- Be conscious of mistakes that I have already done.
	- Learn why they happened and do my best to never repeat them again.
- Look at the price of the delivery.
- [Don’t assume it’s difficult until it is](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10872970).
- Simplicity matters.
	- Don't overcomplicate things for no reason.
- Try to avoid confusion as much as possible.
	- Don't use anything only I can understand and release it in the public.
- Ask questions.
	- Asking questions is a a great thing and being stuck on the same problem or being oblivious how to do some thing is not always a great thing.
	- Be wary of how to [ask questions the right way](../research/asking-questions.md).
- Be aware of my own quirks and ask myself why I have them and why I do what I do.
	- For example I at once had a weird obsession with lowercasing everything just because it _felt_ nicer to have everything lowercased. But that is obviously a weird quirk and does no good to anyone including myself.
- What I make doesn't have to be perfect. It's better to make something than nothing at all, and it's better to share things early to get feedback than spending years trying to perfect something.
- I won't be able to do everything. Setting constraints is key. I want my projects to be focused, rather than growing too much in scope and becoming a "catch all".
- Change location.
	- Work from different places.
	- Meet new people.
	- I am not productive staying in the same spot for too long.
- Focus on the foundations fist.
	- Health (Exercise and Nutrition).
	- Good state of mind.
	- And all else will follow.
- Experiment a lot.
	- Try out any new ideas I have (it is the only way to see if the idea is any good).
	- Don't be afraid to fail.
- Publish my work and share it.
	- Any feedback I can get is very valuable. Plus it helps as many people would probably love to use/read about what I have made. But they will never know if I don't share it.
- Use my brain.
	- Actually think about the problems I have and things I can do with what I have instead of giving up and resorting to other things or exterior help. Think first.
- Share.
	- Without sharing the things I have made, there's a very slim chance someone will ever see them.
- Don't overthink things to the point of not doing anything. If I can't find a reason why not to do something, it's often much better to just do the thing and see where it takes I.
- Take it easy.
	- Don't stress myself too much about not achieving things I want to achieve. What's important is that I try and ideally love what I am doing. Everything else is not worth worrying about.

## Work
- Figure out what you are uniquely the best in the world at because you just love it. And then just find out who or what needs that the most.
- You don’t get paid what you deserve. You get paid what other people think you're worth.

## Relationships
- Treat people as if they are in a sensitive and malleable emotional state all the time.
	- I have the power to uplift friends and strangers with every interaction, large or small.

## Code
- [Readability Matters More Than Correctness](https://xph.us/2017/04/23/readability.html)
- It’s a lot easier to actually just use one screen. Much easier to context switch.
- Comment over my code to explain anything that isn't obvious.
- Run/Right/Fast.
	- Make the code work I write is working. Then I can make it fast (if necessary). Solving the “correct/clean/performant code” problem all at once can be overwhelming. Don’t be overwhelmed. Solve one at a time.
- Reducing the maintenance burden is, for most codebases, the biggest optimization I can do.
	- Of course it's all about striking a balance, but 99% of the time there is a choice between performance and readability, readability is the right answer. Performance should only be chosen if it is absolutely necessary.
- If I write ugly code, anyone who intends to fix a bug or add a feature will not enjoy his work and likely avoid it next time.

## Git
- Use version control.
	- It is a pain to reverse and fix things when I don't know where the problem is.
- Commit all my changes. Do __atomic__ commits. Write proper descriptive commit messages.

## Learning
- Don’t index information for the sake of indexing.
	- Try to see how this piece of knowledge plays a role in on a more higher level.
- Be smart about how to present information in the mind maps.
	- It should be more of a guide and a glue between different things rather than as a way to dump everything in one single file.

## Productivity
- Use the right tool for the job.
	- i.e. mind maps are great for visualising things so don't use them to dump things inside to filter for things. I can use simple markdown and text files for that where it is easier to maintain and extend.
- Slow down. Think about the problem. Don't rush things.

## Asking questions
- When posting an error or an issue on some forum or GitHub, give as much information as I can to help debug it.
	- In the case of posting an issue with an Alfred workflow, it is best to link to the workflow itself and also link what the debugger says when I am running into the issue.
- When asking for feedback, never ask people if they like the product I built. Ask them whether they don't like anything.
	- If I ask them if they like it, there is a high chance they will not say what they dislike because they will fear to hurt I. As if I am asking for validation.
	- Critical feedback and opinion is most useful for feedback.

## Social media
- Don't lock myself into using a service. Have my own system in place and give the social media a purpose. If there is no purpose to it, don't use it.
- Losing control over personal data is horrible. Always be mindful of the services I use and the data they will be extracting from my use of it. If the service disregards my privacy. Avoid it.

## Design
- Giving users many options is more often a bad idea. Instead give very few options but make each one of them count and stand out.

## Building a product
- Have a nice looking website. The first look matters.

## Focusing
- Good jazz or downtempo music is really amazing as background music. Together with low sound of rain or thunder, it really makes I focus and get lost in what I're doing.

## Other
- When proposing feature requests, _"for me"_ is never a good argument for a feature request.
	- If I want someone to add a feature to their software, show how it would be useful to lots of users.
- Explicit over implicit is almost always better.
- Automate backups.
	- Make sure the [backups I've made are actually successful](http://taobackup.com). And I have at least 1 week fresh backup of everything I did. It is best to have offsite backups too.
