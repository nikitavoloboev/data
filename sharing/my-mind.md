Aside from this wiki, I also use various interactive mind maps.

I use the mind maps for many things. Since these maps are interactive and allow you to neatly link information together, they are much better suited for some formats. Like visualising different topics and their relations.

Which you can see and explore [here](https://my.mindnode.com/83qmKgoATj8TyKzprzsPfoirxa2g9WmFGx3xpr1J#1506.8,-1099.0,2).

## Alfred My Mind
I can then also instantly access any of these mind maps or any entry in this wiki from [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) workflow:

Which as the name suggests, acts as my second brain that I use to quickly access anything I [have indexed for myself](../knowledge/knowledge-indexing.md). I share it because I wish other people took this idea and made their own _Alfred My Mind_ or a _Knowledge wiki_ but for their own use. Sharing knowledge and tools like that is very powerful and makes a big difference. As I use and reuse other people's work and knowledge many times a day. It never hurts to add to the mix.

Essentially mind maps act as a digital augmentation of my mind in many ways. I want to visualise knowledge and thoughts and ideas I have and share most of these things with other people through this wiki, [the longer articles I write](../sharing/my-articles.md), the [YouTube videos I make](../sharing/my-youtube.md)  and of course finally through the [code I write](../sharing/my-github.md) to make useful tools, apps and interactive visualisations that all can use and enjoy.

With all that said. The best way to know about me as a person, what I like and what I am into and what I am working on is to read through this wiki. With time, it will contain essentially [everything that I know](everything-I-know.md) _in my own words_.

This wiki acts as a first class citizen and anything that I ultimately want to share or have shared will be written down here, somewhere. Most of the mind maps I have made will be linked to from here and will have some description of the map too.
