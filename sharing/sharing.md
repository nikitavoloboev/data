# Sharing my work
I am currently focusing on working through [my projects](./projects.md), [learning](../working-on/Learning.md) and sharing things I have learned and made.

Here are things I have made thus far and where you can find more about each of the things.

## [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev)
I like to solve problems I have with code and sharing the things I made on GitHub. I map all the repositories I shared as a map [here](https://my.mindnode.com/ZKGETDkUaQUsL3q8q9z788CxG84oEHgDiT79GuzX#49.4,-944.4,0).

## [Blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev)
Contains longer articles I write. I map all the articles I wrote in form of a map [here](https://my.mindnode.com/2YJ1yeqHkxaBMHKDPC1k2Ripxpx9Ne7ULk4rfh3H#460.7,-466.1,-1).

## [Thoughts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev)
I share most of the things I am up to right now on my Twitter page.

## [Videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw)
I mostly focus on making videos about macOS automation as that is what interests me. I list videos I have made as a repository [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-youtube).

## [Streaming on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nikiivi)
I sometimes stream some of the things I am working on for fun on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nikiivi). I try to explain things as I do them. 

## [Photographs on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/)
I don't often share photographs and things but when I do, I upload it there.

## [Music on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev)
I am currently not writing any music of my own although I am learning. I do however share many of the songs I like in [form of playlists](../music/music-plays.md).

## [Curated Images on Imgur](https://nikivii.imgur.com)
I also curate some [Imgur albums](https://nikivii.imgur.com) of various things.

## [Knowledge in this wiki](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/)
I share everything I know in form of this wiki here. Can be easily queried with the search in top left corner and with [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) workflow.
