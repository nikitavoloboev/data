[Karabiner][1] is an absolutely amazing app that lets you remap keys at a very low level on macOS. 

For example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you do hold it, it becomes a [hyper key][2]. Hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes, once when pressed alone and once when held down. So for example for remapping caps lock, we can remap it to act as escape when pressed alone once but if we hold down on it it becomes ⌘ + ⌃ modifier key. So `caps lock + F` becomes ⌘ + ⌃ + F. And so on.

I however take this idea further and define these kind of hyper key but for __every single key on my keyboard__. I like to call them _sticky keys_ and you can read more about it [here][3].
