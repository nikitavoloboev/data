# iTerm
My terminal emulator of choice.

I always have 5 tabs (sessions) open in iTerm. I open other tabs as the need arises and I start working on other projects.

My always open tabs are:
1. `::` - This tab never has a program open inside. It is my `runner` terminal. I have it assigned to open with `f + j` and I use it to run commands that are not project related. It's my `general` kind of session.
2. `play` - Is used to run various projects I have saved in [~/src/play](../../unix/my-file-system.md).
3. `test` - Is used to quickly test out things in varius languages.
4. `kar` - Contains my [Karabiner configuration file](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/karabiner/private.xml) is always open. I have assigned `v + :` to always switch to this tab from no matter what app I am on my system.
5. `vim` - Contains my [vim config file](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/init.vim).

All other tabs are added on top of this `default` configuration. Usually it looks something like this:

Where `la` and `al` are projects I am working on.

I then use [this workflow](https://github.com/isometry/alfred-tty) to quickly switch between many tty sessions:
