# [Contacts](https://support.apple.com/guide/contacts/welcome/mac)

I use Contacts app as a contact book of people I both know and people I am interested in.

I use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/search-content#readme) to quickly search through all my contacts. I add tags (i.e. the name of event we met at or person's skill/interest) to make both the searching and remembering who the person is or what he does easier.
