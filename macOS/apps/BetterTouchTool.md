I use this app for mapping various trackpad gestures to hotkeys and actions as well as quick one to one hotkey mappings for various apps.

I wrote about how I use the app to heavily customise my gestures in detail in an article [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze). 

I mostly use the app to set one way keybindings. That is single key -> key app specific bindings like this one :

And to set up app specific and global gestures. Like this one :

You can view a printed version of all the bindings I have made [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ch3xv362vewsldo/btt-gestures.pdf?dl=1) and you can download the preset I use to try some of the bindings I have made for yourself by importng [my preset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j7o7yu8jm85shd5/main.json?dl=1) to BetterTouchTool.

Here are some images of the gestures I use.
