# [Trello](https://trello.com)
I use the app a lot to track various ongoing things I have in my life.

I share many boards I have [publically](../../sharing/my-trello.md).

I nearly always use two labels: __Important__ and __Next__. And I mark the cards I am working on and set deadlines on most cards. I can only work on the cards I am assigned to. And a card can't have multiple priority labels. It's either __Important__, __Next__ or Assigned (with space).

Nearly all of my own boards are filtered to show only the cards I am assigned to ([Press Q on the board](https://trello.com/shortcuts)).

## Notes
- You can attach link to card by simply selecting card and pressing `⌘ + V`.
	- You can also add a link as a new card itself by simply `⌘ + V`ing in the new card area. This will also fetch the thumbnail and add that to the card and create an appropriate title.
- In the date picker you can just type the number of the month to pick it. Or you can do `13/3` to make a due date for this year on March 13th.
