# [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)

I love IRC and this is the best macOS client for it.

I created my own [Monokai Night theme](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/textual#readme) for it that I love.

## Notes

- I can inspect HTML of the window by going to `HELP -> Advanced -> Enter Developer Mode` and then right clicking on what I want to inspect.
- Right click on chat background and `Force Reload Style` will reapply the styles you made in the active theme (as well as the JS code).
- CMD + enter when typing will render text as `/me` command. OPT + CMD will allow to write multi line text.
- Can jump instantly to a channel using url scheme. With `Developer Mode` enabled, right click on channel and `Copy Unique Identifier`. Then open URL (in KM) like `textual://goto/2F49204B-971F-4016-920B-CC15A308581C` where the thing after `goto/` is the id.
- ⌥⌘U = hide right sidebar.
