# [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/)
I use the app to manage my own personal library of snippets. I prefix all snippets I make. For example vim snippets are prefixed with `vim:`. Git related snippets with `git:` and so on.

This lets me then use the [Alfred workflow](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/press-release/whats-new/osx-1.6.html) that the App's author provides to search for these snippets insanely fast.

Here is how my library looks like:

I share my entire library of snippets you can import yourself [here](snippetslab#readme).
