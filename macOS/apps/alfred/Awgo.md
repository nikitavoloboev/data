# [Awgo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo)
A really awesome library made by [Deanishe](https://github.com/deanishe).

Will try to document things I know on how to effectively use it or at least how I use it here. It is really powerful and when combined with the speed and awesomeness of Go, things can't get better.

## Notes
- using macOS console app is a lot nicer than using Alfred debugger
	- you can access it by running `workflow:log` in a script filter
	- where `workflow:` is a magic argument with a bunch of other dev related things you can run
- you need to add unique UID to have Alfred learn from your usage
