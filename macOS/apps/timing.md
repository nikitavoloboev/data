# [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en)
I use Timing app to fully automate tracking my time on my computer.

The fact that I can combine active and passive tracking together is very powerful and allows me to be more aware of where I spend my time.

## Notes
- Can press ⌥ + → in `Review` tab to expand all items fully (assuming I selected the items I want to expand). Can `CMD+A` to select all projects beforehand.
- Running `defaults write info.eurocomp.Timing2 letTaskSuggestionsOverrideExistingProjects -bool true` would make task suggestions independent of current project.
