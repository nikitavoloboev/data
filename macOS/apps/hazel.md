# [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com)
I currently use Hazel to instantly commit any changes I make to CSV files of [web searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches), [ask-create-share](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share) as well as all of [LA's curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme). And essentially any kind of curated lists. I even automate commiting the README of [my macOS](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) repo as I want to instantly push any changes I make to the repo.

Since I want to keep my macOS repo always updated, I made a macro to open the README file in Sublime Text so I can quickly make a change, save and the change will instantly be commited with `Update readme` message.

The rule for this is really simple and looks like this:

## Notes
- If you want to have your rules to be applied onto subfolders as well as the directory chosen, add this rule.

- If extensions are hidden, don't add extensions in the rule editor too.
