# [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.

Has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.

I share [all the macros I use](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/km-macros#readme) with the app.

### KM actions
- [Assert action](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/assert-action/8374) - "if not condition then fail".
	- Useful for checking if you got right kind of data.

## Notes
- It is always better to run compiled Applescripts.
