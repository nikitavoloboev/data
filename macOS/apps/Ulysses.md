# [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/)
The app I use to do all my writing in.

I use it to both write this wiki you are reading now as well as everything else that has to do with writing somehow except writing GitHub readme's. For that I use [MacDown](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown).

Here is how my workflow with Ulysses looks like.

# content structure
I group my writing into appropriate categories. Here are how my categories look like. I blurred some that are personal to me.

And I use two [alfred file filters](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/) to search through both Ulysses sheets and Ulysses groups.

Only thing I do is that I add a `tab` keypress after the sheet is opened so that immediately after the sheet is opened, the focus is on the text of the sheet and not the sidebar.

How I use Ulysses to edit this wiki can be seen [here](../meta/meta.md).

# tagging sheets 
I tag Ulysses sheets I am currently writing and focusing on with `#writing` tag like this :

Which allows me to quickly search and filter through Ulysses sheets quickly from Alfred :

Here are some more tags I use :
-  `#idea`
	- will often just contain a title and maybe some notes of what I want it to be about
- `#soon`
	- indicates that this should be worked on after all of `#writing` articles are done
Here is how a sheet with an idea looks like :

I have many like it in `writing` group. The little `#idea` heading is used to quickly note down some ideas or thoughts I have about what the article should be about. As I write the article I usually try to address these points one by one until I cover everything I want to say.
