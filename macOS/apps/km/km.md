# Keyboard Maestro

[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) is essentially an IDE for automation. 

You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.

I share all the macros I have made in repo [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/km-macros).

[Keyboard Maestro Forum](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/latest) is a really awesome place to discuss all things related to KM.
