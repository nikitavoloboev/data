# [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)
2Do together with [MindNode](mindnode) and [Trello](trello) acts as as my second brain. Where 2Do is focused on actionable tasks that I have to complete in [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) style.

Here is how my sidebar looks:

## Managing tasks with tags
My main way of managing tasks is with `tags`. This lets me give scope to the task I want to complete and lets me filter through the many thousands of tasks I have in my `Inbox`. Here is a brief glimpse of what tags I add:

I also add time estimates to tasks like so:

This is useful because sometimes I can simply open a tag `10m` and see all tasks with this short time frame so I can quickly complete them and get on build on the momentum. I don't add time estimates to all tasks but I try to add it where possible.

## Notes
- Go to 2Do list from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/showList?name=next` (would go to to `next` list).
- Filter 2Do tag from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/search?text=tags:bug` (would show all tasks with `bug` tag)
