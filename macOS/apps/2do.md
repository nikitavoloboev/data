# [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)
I love GTD methodology, this application is phenomenal with helping me organise my tasks and things I want to do and achieve. Here is how my sidebar looks:

And it has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.

## Managing tasks with tags
My main way of managing tasks is with __tags__. This lets me give scope to the task I want to complete and lets me filter through the many thousands of tasks I have in my __Inbox__. Here is a brief glimpse of what tags I add:

I also add time estimates to tasks like so:

This is useful because sometimes I can simply open a tag __10m__ and see all tasks with this short time frame so I can quickly complete them and get on build on the momentum. I don't add time estimates to all tasks but I try to add it where possible.

## Notes
- Go to 2Do list from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/showList?name=next` (would go to to __next__ list).
- Filter 2Do tag from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/search?text=tags:bug` (would show all tasks with __bug__ tag)
