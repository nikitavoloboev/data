# [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)

I love GTD methodology. This app is phenomenal with helping me organize my tasks. Here is how my sidebar looks:

It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.

## My 2Do tasks shared

I share [contents of some of my never ending lists of tasks I tagged in 2Do](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/c8b71bfb06634877bbcf94ef2fc0c95f) with `read`, `watch` and `check` tags.

All lists are sorted by priority. I hope to bring all these lists closer to 0 when I get time. But until then, perhaps you will find something interesting in them.

## Managing tasks with tags

My main way of managing tasks is with **tags**. This lets me give scope to the task I want to complete and lets me filter through the many thousands of tasks I have in my **Inbox**.

I create many smart lists of most common tags I want to jump to. I use `J` key and macros that activate the URL scheme to jump between the lists.

I also add time estimate tags to tasks that I think might take me 1 hour or longer:

I share the same philosophy of `Always` and `Temporary` projects as I have in my [Focus Trello board](../../focusing/focusing.md).

And here are the other tags I use:

I made my `All` list sorted by `Modified date`. This lets me cleanly delete or act on all tasks that have been sitting in my 2Do for too long with no activity.

## Recurring tasks

I use recurring scheduled tasks in 2Do as a way to remember to complete my day/week/monthly reviews which I often do in the evenings of particular days.

## URL Scheme

[2Do URL schemes documentation](https://www.2doapp.com/kb/article/url-schemes.html) has everything. I use these URL schemes currently:

- Go to 2Do list from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/showList?name=Read` (would go to to **Read** list).
- Filter 2Do tag from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/search?text=tags:github` (would show all tasks with **github** tag)
