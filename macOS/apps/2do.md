# [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)

I love GTD methodology. This app is phenomenal with helping me organize my tasks. Here is how my sidebar looks:

It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.

## Managing tasks with tags

My main way of managing tasks is with **tags**. This lets me give scope to the task I want to complete and lets me filter through the many thousands of tasks I have in my **Inbox**.

I create many smart lists of most common tags I want to jump to. I use `J` key and macros that activate the URL scheme to jump between the lists.

I also add time estimates to tasks like so:

I don't add time estimates to all tasks but I try to add it where possible.

I share the same philosophy of `Always` and `Temporary` projects as I have in my [Focus Trello board](../../focusing/focusing.md).

Given my growing collection of tasks I am yet to do. Some 2,000 pending tasks. I decided to share [some tasks I keep in 2Do publicly](../../other/2do-tasks.md).

And here are the other tags I use:

I made my `All` list sorted by `Modified date`. This lets me cleanly delete or act on all tasks that have been sitting in my 2Do for too long with no activity.

## Recurring tasks

I use recurring scheduled tasks in 2Do as a way to remember to complete my day/week/monthly reviews which I often do in the evenings of particular days.

## URL Scheme

[2Do URL schemes documentation](https://www.2doapp.com/kb/article/url-schemes.html) has everything. I use these URL schemes currently:

- Go to 2Do list from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/showList?name=Read` (would go to to **Read** list).
- Filter 2Do tag from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/search?text=tags:github` (would show all tasks with **github** tag)
