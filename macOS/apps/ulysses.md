# [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/)

The app I use to write all my [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) articles in.

All your writing in one place is the motto and the underlying design of the app. I hook up my [wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) as an external folder and I love how it creates an index of everything that I can search over:

It also has pretty awesome export functions that let you export the text you write to PDF, ePub and HTML. I mostly use it's ability to export text to Medium.

I use [Monokai Night](https://styles.ulyssesapp.com/bundle/Monokai+Night/5bbcb619b3dafa6b4e6d6bd4) theme when I write. Here is how it looks:

I describe my thoughts and approach to writing [here](../../writing/writing.md).
