# [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/)

The app I use to write all my [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) articles in.

All your writing in one place is the motto and the underlying design of the app. I hook up my [wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) as an external folder and I love how it creates an index of everything that I can search over:

It also has pretty awesome export functions that let you export the text you write to PDF, ePub and HTML. I mostly use it's ability to export text to Medium.

I use [Night Blue](https://styles.ulyssesapp.com/bundle/Night+Blue/5b8573cd4f286f5c23d613d5) theme when I write. Here is how it looks:

I describe my thoughts and approach to writing [here](../../writing/writing.md).

## Content structure

I group my writing into appropriate categories. Here are how my categories look like.

I use two [Alfred file filters](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/search-files#readme) to search through both Ulysses sheets and Ulysses groups.

## Notes
