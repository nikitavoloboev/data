# macOS
macOS is my [favourite desktop operating system](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os#readme).

I do wish to expand my horizons and try out Linux more. I doubt I will ever be able to move to another operating system as I have too much invested in optimising and using macOS but I do want to take the best of all worlds. Linux is open source, has an increasingly large community of users and developers and one thing that I love about UNIX systems is that by using these systems you effectively become a developer. Because otherwise you are simply missing out on the _full experience_.

In any way, I like to think my journey with macOS, operating systems, programming and the like has only begun, I am still yet to make something substantial, something akin to [Karabiner](apps/karabiner/karabiner.md). But I am getting there.

## Notes
- In save dialogues I can press these keys:
	- `Return` or `⌘ + S` = Save
	- `ESC` = Cancel
- I can also press `/` or `~` to quickly go to some directory from a save dialogue. And I can press `⌘ + ↑` to go to `parent directory`.
