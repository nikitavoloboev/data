# Knowledge
I don't know many things. And as the saying goes: _"The more you know, the more you don't know."_

I list things I am learning and want to learn in a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q).

I also visualize some topics and their relations as an [interactive mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/uQPgJs5DnVaAqyR9yrqxySQB6sCDRy2bmb7yxqKg#1653.2,-925.0,2).
