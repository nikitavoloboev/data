# Things I know
I don't know many things. And as the saying goes _"The more you know the more you don't know."_

Still, I would like to know in some ways thing I do _know_. In my opinion of course. Everything can be mastered further and improved upon.

## I know well
- Mind maps
	- I really love this little knowledge transcribing format and I would say I got pretty good at transcribing my thoughts and ideas in it with time
- Workflow optimisation
	- I am insanely fast at my computer and my keyboard and I set out myself on the endless path of micro and macro optimisations that I think I am getting better at with every day
