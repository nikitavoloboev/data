# Knowledge
I don't know many things. And as the saying goes: _"The more you know the more you don't know."_

Still, I would like to know in some ways thing I do _know_. In my opinion of course. Everything can be mastered further and improved upon.

I list things I am learning and want to learn as a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q). And I list skills I think I am good at on my [CV](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/nikitavoloboev).
