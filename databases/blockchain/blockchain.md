# [Blockchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

In short, blockchain is a [immutable linked list of hashes](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-blockchain-essentially-a-linked-list). Which can be used to solve the double spending problem in cryptocurrencies using proof of stake (or other methods) and a persistent chain of records (blocks mined).

[Ethereum, Solana, Tezos & Avalanche are nice blockchains](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1434279108872216577).

## Consensus algorithms

- PoW: The more hashing power the more trust worthy.
- PoS: The more coins the more trust worthy.
- PBFT: Hand selected trusted nodes.
- Randomized asynchronous algorithm: You trust nobody! Every single node is constantly re-evaluated. ([Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net))

## Interesting NFTs

- [5 Minutes of Fame NFT](https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1437808708998688774) - Buy this NFT & get 5 min air time on podcast.

## Notes

- [As blockchain scalability gets better and better, and UX improves and fees drop as a result, this will become a bigger and bigger part of the story.](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1072158957999771648)
- [For any given file on the internet, it is unknowable now many NFTs might be pointing to it. So putting aside all the questions about what "ownership" actually means in this context (spoiler: almost nothing), it's not possible to know who owns a file just by looking at the file.](https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/1381616082868436992)
- [NFTs are being wash traded. That’s when the buyer and the seller are secretly the same person.](https://twitter.com/JWWeatherman_/status/1431373325842923527)
- [Keep L1 simple and decentralized and scale on L2.](https://twitter.com/latetot/status/1437794513389592587)
- [NFTs are a Ponzi scheme, corroborated by many reputable sources.](https://twitter.com/castpixel/status/1438063396772007937)
- [Person: web3 is empowering creators! Me: Oh so it's like a decentralized network like mastodon? Person: no it's like web 2.0 plus blockchain.](https://twitter.com/ReinH/status/1442536279409774597)
- [I would read an essay about how appeals to "community" in crypto have totally obscured power relations, governance, who makes money, and who's scamming who. This is an industry (wildly anarchic, unregulated, unequal, run by capital), not a community.](https://twitter.com/mims/status/1448253915976421376)
- [How NFTs can be used for money laundering: Someone pays "for the NFT" when they're actually paying for something illicit. Having the NFT can make it appear to be a legitimate transaction, so they can deposit the funds without the IRS losing their mind.](https://twitter.com/sageheroRC/status/1449020958463901702)
- [I believe what makes NFTs different is a transformative vision of a future that true believers find inspiring and achievable. In their eyes, the current speculative bubble is a mechanism for growing something enduring.](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1450886698951340033)
- [Recognizing the spiritual hunger that sits at the core of these movements (and remember how many in the space are young people!) is an important step to understanding them. Crypto culture is a mirror world that feeds off of the unexamined failures of the real world.](https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1450886210914709506)
- [One of the coolest things about crypto is being able to fork mainnet locally and just like...experiment with building on top of other peoples' contracts without hitting them. Such a mindset shift from web2. like you can turn the whole web into a staging environment. wild.](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1458553279562989571)
- [The only API you should trust is one controlled by a blockchain. Can’t be evil > don’t be evil. There’s key digital information (money, identity, digital assets, etc.) that users should have ultimate control of, and if this was trivially easy to access between apps, that would lead to vastly more innovation in software.](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1461723922336915459)
- [You can actually download all NFT images stored on sol/eth/tezos chains. Write software that will scan every block on any chain from genesis and if the links to an image (probably IPFS url), then download it to a directory. Do it for any chain and can do it continuously as a running program then create a gallery URL perhaps. Essentially build a web page in which images stored on chain are streamed and shown in real from different chains.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29290156)
