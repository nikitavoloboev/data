# [Blockchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

In short, blockchain is a [immutable linked list of hashes](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-blockchain-essentially-a-linked-list?share=1). Which can be used to solve the double spending problem in cryptocurrencies using proof of work (or other methods) and a persistent chain of records (blocks mined).

## Consensus algorithms

- PoW: The more hashing power the more trust worthy.
- PoS: The more coins the more trust worthy.
- PBFT: Hand selected trusted nodes.
- Randomized asynchronous algorithm: You trust nobody! Every single node is constantly re-evaluated. ([Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net))

## Interesting applications

- [Horizon State](https://horizonstate.com/) - Digital voting.
- [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/) - Decentralized apps on Blockstack let you own your data so you can maintain your privacy, security and freedom.
- [Cardano](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/) - Cryptographic currency implementing Ouroboros PoS protocol.
- [Iden3](https://iden3.io/) - Decentralized identity management solution.
- [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/) - Through blockchain-based, decentralized platforms, we enable the redistribution of resources—from assets to incentives, and information to ideas.

## Notes

- [As blockchain scalability gets better and better, and UX improves and fees drop as a result, this will become a bigger and bigger part of the story.](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1072158957999771648)
