## Diary
- (2) Stopped listening to music for a while now. I now listen to music as a way to find new tunes and relax rather than as a way to listen to things just to dull the background noise. I use [Noizio](http://noiz.io) for that now and love it. So my last.fm is looking a bit empty compared to the previous months.
- (2) Also renamed `Notes` to `Diary` as I think I found a perfect workflow that really works for me in doing this kind of diary. `Shared`, `Diary` and `Photos` is all I really want to remember from the month. Private memories and notes will still be in Day One. A `Travel` section would be really awesome to have too.
- (2) One of my goals in Trello board this month is: `Mindful everything. Writing. Working. Coding.`. It's really freeing coming down and using only the essential things and living with a more reductionist approach of minimising both daily input to things that matter as well as focusing on pruducing work that really matters too. No bullshit inbetween. My Trello `Focus` board is starting to pay its devidends too. I now keep all my Trello boards scoped to cards that I am assigned to. Which means cards I am currently working on. This way I can tune to work only on the projects & goals that matter to me at that given time. For now, my goal is to finish my university and finally getting my Bachelor's degree.

- (4) [Richard Litt](https://github.com/RichardLitt) also started a public monthly diary log of things he is working on and he wrote a bit on [why he made it](https://richardlitt.github.io/2018-april/2018/04/04/11-31-why-am-i-writing-on-this-site/) with which I agree. This diary is also only the beggining. I am certain in future, these `looking back` posts will probably not even be hosted with GitBook but perhaps lie on my personal site. With better visualisations and much shorter and to the point entries as I learn more on how to effectively transcribe my thoughts on paper and what things to write about. So yeah, diaries are pretty awesome.
- (9) I feel like I can write a book about decision fatigue and the paradox of choice. It has been a growing issue in my life for too long of a time and despite me being 'aware' of the issue, I still fall in the same trap of inability to do things because there is just 'too many things' I need to be doing and too much pressure on doing things right. Priorotising the right things, accepting to fail at something because something else is more important. It's painful and above all frustrating. Which in turns causes me to enter a rather negative loop of self hatred and depression. Not even self hatred but hate for me not being able to change my surroundings in a meaningful way because I have no money, I can't finish my degree and a plethora of other reasons like having 0 internships or any kind of work experience. Because literally no one on Earth wants to hire me. I did find this [Wisdom of Insecurity](https://antilogicalism.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/wisdom-of-insecurity.pdf) book by no other than Alan Watts. It's funny how even when you are 'aware' of how irrational it is to feel sad or to feel any kind of anxiety, you still feel it. And it still hurts.
