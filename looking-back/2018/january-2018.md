## FB blocked Learn Anything
Learn Anything was banned from both Facebook and Instagram platforms.

No one can share or send messages of the website to anyone. Facebook won't allow it.

It's a real shame how a company can dictate what other people see or say and will block anything that even remotely questions the ethics of what they do.

My last post on FB. Have no idea why I didn't delete my account already given things I know about the company.

Will be exploring [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz) and other decentralised solutions for sharing news and communicating. It makes no sense to live in a world where a company can choose what its users should see, do or talk about.

## Highlights
- [Added all the Keyboard Maestro macros I use and love to my macOS repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/km).

## Changes
- Started using Trello a lot more.
