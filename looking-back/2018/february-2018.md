# February 2018
## Highlights
- Completely updated my wiki and now everything is quite clean and tidy.
- Started using [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font. And generally started to pay attention to fonts more. Fira Code is amazing.

## Changes
- Started using Ship app more often for GitHub issues.
	- Will try to triage as many open issues I have across all my repos.
	- Have a pretty sweet setup going with 2Do, Trello, Fantastical and Ship.
