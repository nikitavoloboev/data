# February 2018
## Highlights
- Completely updated my wiki and now everything is quite clean and tidy.
- Started using [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font. And generally started to pay attention to fonts more. Fira Code is amazing.
- Automated [dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
- Started discussing and working on new version of Learn Anything. Will have two modes: `Explore` and `Learn`. Made some mockup for both of the modes.

## Changes
- Started using Ship app more often for GitHub issues.
	- Will try to triage as many open issues I have across all my repos.
	- Have a pretty sweet setup going with 2Do, Trello, Fantastical and Ship.
- Will try not use mind map for documenting my Karabiner config but try a method of self documenting.
- Will try to be a lot more active on Twitter. It's a pretty amazing platform.
- Taking Git and Git workflow a lot more seriously. Atomic commits. And coding. Lots more coding. Also started to use Tower app for for my Git workflow. It's working pretty great so far.
	- I also automated quite a lot of my Git activity. Specifically I learned that most commits if not all start with an _action_ so I automated inserting `Update ` words in Tower as well as many more things. Plus I automated a lot of same `Update` commits that I do for my [knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) repo. It genuinely saves a ton of time.
- Moved all my Go workflows to use Kingpin. Makes updating and extending workflows a lot easier which I should do in the coming time.
- Started to use Spotify's `make song radio` of the song a lot more aggresively. My current Spotifiy workflow is pretty awesome. I find a song I like, I quickly add the song to [Likes](spotify:user:nikitavoloboev:playlist:0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn) with `m + g`. If I _really_ like the song, then I add it to my [Nirvana](spotify:user:nikitavoloboev:playlist:0epiRzQHjdJieYr0y3TdST) playlist. And then I can start a song radio of the song to see what other cool things Spotify throws my way. I should start making my own music too although my knowledge of music and music theory is 0.

## Thoughts
- I am thinking how I can experiment with this monthly overview more. `Highlights` and `Changes` seem quite important topics I want to go over in each month. I think I want to drop down some `thoughts` I have too in some form. Just for prosterity. Plus I really do want to write more often, I think it's better to focus on that more rather than just dropping some random thoughts here.
- In other news though, I think this month, I really am starting to realise more just how absurd my past behaviours were in regards to my life and education. I really want to make cool stuff and I deeply felt that everything around me was limiting me in some way but I should treat it differently. I should embrace everything as a learning opportunity and take the best from the cards I have been dealt just like my [lessons learned](../../life/lessons-learned.md) state. But above all I should just take small steps every day to achieve my goals and not live in some fantasy or fantasies. Just make things I want to make and see what comes out of it.
