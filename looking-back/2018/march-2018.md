## Changes
- (2) Going to use Trello exclusively for managing projects.
- (4) Adding this change from iOS. Moved the wiki to Dropbox and hooked up Ulysses to edit the folder on iOS. Pretty amazing.
- (5) Made my first crypto purchase. Pretty awesome experience.
- (7) Removed lessons learned from wiki. Only have [rules](../../focusing/rules.md), [processes](../../focusing/processes.md) and [routine](../../focusing/routine.md) now. Each of the files is binded to a key so I can open in a second. Should itearate on all of it with time and find what works the best for me.
- (7) 10,000 ⭐ on Learn Anything. 🎊

- (10) Started usig [Gitter](https://gitter.im/learn-anything) and our [Reddit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnanything_) as our official way to communicate with the community. Slack was a closed silo that doesn't work well with OSS projects.

## Thoughts
- (1) Going to take Timing a __lot__ more seriously this month. And get some work done!
- (4) Cryptocurrencies are really the future of money. No fees. Instant pay across the globe. Peer to peer with no intermediaries. It's exciting.
- (7) Still wonder what it's like to work at a company or even a startup. Being a one person team for all my life aside from Learn Anything project and Angelo is quite tiring and brings you down with time. I think being surrounded by a team of people who inspire and empower you is amazing. Maybe one day I can find myself to be in that team.
- (7) Going to use and abuse IFTTT a bit more and rally various online info I create like Tweets I made into Google spreadsheets. I want to make some meaningful analysis on this data later + it's nice to save for proseterity as I can save it as PDF for later viewing.
- (8) Will review all movies I watch from now on.
