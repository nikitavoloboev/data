Things you do and words you speak matter.

It's sad how much time is wasted arguing over how [corrupt United States](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/fx03ri/upm_me_all_dogs_lays_out_the_trump/) government is and how things need change.

Just want to be a human being. Loving [animals](../../animals/animals.md) and going about my day existing.

So much news, so pointless.

I am reading some books now:

- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829182.Computer_Systems)
- [Algorithms Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145055.Algorithm_Design)
- [xv6 a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28241422-xv6-a-simple-unix-like-teaching-operating-system)
- [Hitchhiker’s Guide to Logical Veriﬁcation](https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2020/blob/master/hitchhikers_guide.pdf) ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22794533))
- [Linus Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/)
- [Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44065062-something-deeply-hidden)
- [Physics from Symetry](http://physicsfromsymmetry.com/)

No more trash news.
