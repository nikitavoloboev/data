# 2020 April

[US is a failed state](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/fx03ri/upm_me_all_dogs_lays_out_the_trump/). It's genuinely [absurd how obvious and corrupt](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fumh2n/megathread_president_donald_trump_fires/?sort=top) Trump administration is. Casually [firing an overview inspector over 2.2T bill](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fwp42m/megathread_president_donald_trump_removes/?sort=top). Fortunately I don't live in US and don't pay taxes only for them to go to select few people and none going to the benefit of working people. It's just sad, specifically because these actions affect the entire world too with the whole disregard of US for planet Earth and its future.

What puzzles me most though is how easily manipulative the people at large are. You go to Reddit and you are certain that Bernie Sanders is going to win as he is the only candidate that actually wants to drive change in the country in favor of the people. And yet. [Biden wins](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fx8hga/megathread_bernie_sanders_ends_2020_democratic/?sort=top) in polls by large margin all because people get their news from media and/or can't think. And not vote of course. Just bizarre.

I do wonder who will win the election if the election will even take place in 2020. Russia, China and now US. Pretty big countries with influence saying goodbye to democracy for good. At least before democracy was about brainwashing & manipulating people to vote for mostly empty promises, now we got to the point where the country actively [suppresses people to vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fwr2vl/voting_in_wisconsin_during_a_pandemic/) and disregards all laws in plain sight.

Never been into politics as it's mostly a waste of time in that you read things but you feel ever more helpless. It's a superpower when you focus on changing and building things that you have actual influence over. Creating over mindless consuming.

So yeah, going to read books now that I have time and space to think and create freely. It's nice in Netherlands, in some way you don't feel that anything has happened (in terms of global pandemic that is). I mean restaurants are closed but all the shops that exist in all honesty shouldn't even exist in 2020. I'd rather give that space back in service of animals. All you really need is some warehouses and you can already buy/try anything online using AR, no point in having physical shops (not supermarkets) with humans wasting valuable time on this planet doing pointless things.

Also 7 billion people. And of that so few use a computer to a level where they feel empowered to code basic things to improve their life. It's tragic. More tragic than the virus. In US at least where the entire system is rigged against your success.

## No more complaints

It's been a while I complained in my journal like that. And the last time I was complaining about myself not the outside world. Now that I got my life together, I am confident in what value I can create (although not monetize) & I am incredibly happy. It's just annoying how other actors in this game of life can't behave accordingly. There is not much you need in life to be happy, why cause all this pain and suffering to other humans and animals.

I am reading some good books now:

- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829182.Computer_Systems)
- [Algorithms Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145055.Algorithm_Design)
- [xv6 a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28241422-xv6-a-simple-unix-like-teaching-operating-system)
- [Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44065062-something-deeply-hidden)

Some good stuff in there. And have these tabs open:

- https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/postgresql-schema-design/
- https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22739121

As I try to setup backend for LA. Not sure yet how to expose postgres to the front end in nextJS. Will try out Prisma if it works well, if it doesn't will probably setup Hasura instead and write all the backend logic inside go services.

Also I have a bind `v+.` that will play a Focus song and I often change it as I get tired of listening to one song 24/7 but [this Nils Frahm song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1LjaunC39SgsMZEln8EpDj?si=GlXYSpsATuedi5NLvnK3gw). It's too good. Probably 5th day now and it's just beautiful.
