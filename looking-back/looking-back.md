# Looking back
I want to share my journey in life both for myself and other people who might find an interest in it. I will document each month and all the memorable things that happened in these months.

In each of the months I track changes that happened to my life as well as some thoughts I had and highlights from that month. The numbers before each of the dashed points like (21) signify the day of the month I wrote the line in. I also do yearly reviews.

## [2017](2017/2017.md)
> Interesting year. Learn Anything was born. Started doing this wiki.

## 2018
> Have many hopes for the year. The first year that I will be viewing and documenting my life in this wiki here. Hope to build some awesome things too.
