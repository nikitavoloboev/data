Just realized how much time I wasted with Timing. Filed a feature request that hopefully adds Timing automatically inferring projects for me based on rules it already has.

I have no idea why I haven't done that sooner. Oh well. Move on. No more wasting time!

Honestly though I am just so tired. Tired of all the mistakes I made. Fortunately I have a framework now. A set of [rules](../../focusing/rules.md) I try to follow and refine as I progress. Everything else doesn't matter. Just time and focus. Make. Learn. Write. Design. Share.

I will try to grow [build to learn](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/build-to-learn) a lot bigger than what it is now. It is nice to take breaks and not always be in a rush. Life is not crazy. I am just a human. It's quite crazy to me how big the world is. Billions of people. And only few people know about Karabiner. And even fewer about [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo). How wild is that.

I honestly marvel at how much locked potential we have. I just want to do good. And I want to be independent. Because honestly I can be at this point. And all this wasted time with Timing and everything else I have done in life. All the silly games and micro optimizations. Don't matter. You are really no one. You are what you create.

It's so freeing to have a journal and out of this world tools. No more silos.
