# 2019 April

My last month working at Enpicom. It's incredible to see a complex web app (platform) be created in front of your eyes and be a part of building it.

Aside from that, this will be the month I genuinely start working on LA 1.0

I grew in love with the vision of Learn Anything as a platform for ideas. Where learning is the core part of how these ideas can come alive. Only thing left is to build it, finally. It's an enormous project.
