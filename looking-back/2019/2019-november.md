# 2019 November

### 18-24

Rebuilding personal site with React & Gatsby. Using [Otta](https://otta.com) to find a nice job in London. Minimized number of projects that Timing has to bare essentials. Makes tracking easier and hopefully the overviews much clearer too as I can clearly see how my time was spent.

I try my best to not waste any time in anything I do. Hopefully one day I get to a stage where I can slow down and appreciate life more. Right now it really is just a hassle. Just need experience. And more failures. With some successes.

It's first time I do this weekly reflection. Want to have a more clearer & ongoing reflection of my life. It's a nice mind cleanser. I started to enjoy both failures and successes equally well. They both mean one thing. I am moving forward.
