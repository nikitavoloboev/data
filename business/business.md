## Notes

- [Organizations should outgrow their founders.](https://twitter.com/joshsimmons/status/1379326794373898242)
- [Product-market fit heals and forgives almost everything. The highest order bit is almost the only thing that matters by a long shot, to a dramatic and unintuitive degree.](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1382128300189839360)

- [A small team of great engineers can make just a shocking amount of progress. This is one of the most unintuitive things for business people who tend to think more linearly in terms of team size vs. output.](https://twitter.com/jaltma/status/1395479778346426372)

- [In corporate jobs, the best employees make their manager’s lives easier which encourages giving them more scope and responsibility. You get there by being autonomous instead of needing regular guidance, bringing solutions not problems and taking ownership when you don’t have to.](https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1408423307494400004)
- [The moment you initiate a business relationship with anyone outside of your company, you should be registering it, as the contracts should be between the corporate entity and the vendor rather than you (personally) with the vendor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/oz8m6m/registering_a_company/)
- [As a principal engineer, sometimes my title intimidates people (at my job). I see it when people are sharing ideas or code. I’m thinking of ways to tackle this, but wanted to share that your title may carry weight. What are you doing to build inclusive and equitable environments?](https://twitter.com/bryanl/status/1441441208321069060)
