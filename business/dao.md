## Notes

- [Turns out one of the killer use cases of NFTs has nothing to do with art. Instead they allow the bootstrapping of a community of thousands of smart, hungry people working towards a common goal. all of them sharing ownership and equity.](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1459546438531264514)
- [Web3 returns us to a p2p world. Corporations can't advertise effectively. People can. And that means people need three ingredients: 1. Incentives (reasons). 2. Memes (talking points). 3. Values (belief). Projects to bet on are the ones that optimize for all three.](https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1459638301967716360)
- [You do not need past experience to start a DAO. The best communities discover web3 as a natural growth solution. There are no pre-requisites to sharing ownership with those who deserve it.](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1459620316024557570)
- [Creating a DAO showcases how web3 can support methods of giving a voice to those who have been voiceless and/or discriminated against in the past.](https://twitter.com/WRLobkowicz/status/1461401594122182662)
- [Would love to see a platform launch DAOs that don’t bother using crypto: LLC, buy membership via Stripe/Plaid, legally enforceable contracts, voting via web app + a proxy. We have all the tools to do it without massive gas fees and other problems right now.](https://twitter.com/tylertringas/status/1463134973473570819)
