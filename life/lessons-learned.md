# Code
- use switch cases over long ifs

	- much easier to context switch
- use version control
	- and commit your changes
	- it is a pain to reverse and fix things when you don't know where the problem is
	- do __atomic__ commits
- comment over my code!
	- especially zsh functions, makes things easier to read

# Using Mind maps
- don’t index information for the sake of indexing
	- try to see how this piece of knowledge plays a role in on a more higher level
- be smart about how to present information in the mind maps
	- it should be more of a guide and a glue between different things rather than as a way to dump everything in one single file
