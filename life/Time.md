# Time

Being aware of time is something I always strive to do. Planning my time in advance, setting goals and giving purpose to what I do is something that helps me lead a more conscious life. I also try to take into account time when making any new decision.

I wrote a little [alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-time) for fun to remind myself how long I have lived on this planet.
