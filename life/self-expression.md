# Self Expression
Anything that I do is ultimately self expression. It's that often times I was afraid to express myself. Fearing what other people would think or say. But the reality is that it is quite silly to try and limit your life and thoughts and feelings to what you think you have to think or feel or do.

Always feeling like you are in a race with other people is not a good way to live a life.
