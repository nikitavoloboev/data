# Death

I try to live my life [enjoying each moment](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) and moving towards the [future I want](../future/future.md). [One day I will die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc). And I don't want to regret any of the precious and limited time I spent in here.

I don't much think about life after death as [there is no point to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU0PYcCsL6o). I don't think about going to sleep or waking up, it just happens.

If I can form and retrieve memories, I am alive. So I try to do my best in making that process going smoothly with [proper exercise](../fitness/fitness.md), [sleep](../sleep/sleep.md) and [happy outlook on life](happiness.md).

Its nice there are many humans working on [aging and longevity](../health/aging.md), specifically rejuvenation & eradication of diseases. I hope to contribute to the field too soon.

From the psychedelic experiences I had in my life, I learned to appreciate the complex nature that is the human brain. Its ability to detect patterns in everything and draw connections is truly marvelous. Listening to all of [Alan Watts's works](../humans/alan-watts.md) on some [tryptamine](../drugs/psychedelics/tryptamines/tryptamines.md) or [lysergamide](../drugs/psychedelics/lysergamides/lysergamides.md) is something everyone should try to do once in their life as in my personal experience it made me truly content with my place in the universe. There is no meaning but the one you care enough to care about. And it seems the only true goal of conscious life is to understand itself. Explore the cosmos.

The other neat thing about psychedelics is their ability to [induce ego death by shutting off default mode network](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Psilocybin_and_the_Default_Mode_Network). Having your short term memories suppressed so much that you forget that you even took the drug or that you were/are a human being is crazy experience. I had this on [Salvia](../drugs/psychedelics/salvia.md) and life is never really the same after this. Even if it's all just a drug.

With all that said, there is only one real conclusion to draw knowing all this. Have fun. Be nice. And don't worry about what might happen or what has already happened. In the end, it seems even the [universe will eventually go dark and 'die'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA). Probably to eventually be reborn again.

Spend more time with ones you care about. Be [aware of your ego](../consciousness/ego.md) and be a [kind and loving person](../environment/veganism.md).

## Notes

- [Whether you fight it or go with the flow, the same result will appear, the body will dissolve until all that is left is the consciousness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/7rq9f4/5meodmt_5_mg_trip_report_relax_nothing_is_under/)
  - You mistakenly call your consciousness your soul. But you are right, it was ripped from your body because you fail to realize that they are not the same. You are life having a human experience, not a human having a life experience. You felt it, you were not alive or dead, you just were.
- It is one of the most remarkable things that in all of the biological sciences there is no clue as to the necessity of death. If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable and that it is only a matter of time before the biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble and that this terrible universal disease or temporariness of the human’s body will be cured. - Richard Feynman
- [The fact that it ceases to exist in deep sleep and under anesthesia is strong evidence that there is no afterlife for "you."](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/ghhyd6/why_people_say_they_believe_a_dmt_breakthrough/)
- [So then, when you die, you’re not going to have to put up with everlasting non-existence. Because that's not an experience. A lot of people are afraid that when they die they’re going to be locked up in a dark room forever and sort of undergo that. But one of the most interesting things in the world – this is a yoga, this is a way of realization. Try and imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up. Think about that. Children think about that. It’s one of the great wonders of life. What will it be like to go to sleep and never wake up? And if you think long enough about that, something will happen. You will find out, among other things. That it will pose the next question to you. What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born. You see? You cant have an experience of nothing; Nature abhors a vacuum. So after you're dead, the only thing that can happen is the same experience, or the same sort of experience of before you were born. In other words, we all know very well that after people die. Other people are born. And they're all you, only you can only experience one at a time. Everybody is I, you all you are you. - Alan Watts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/ljizj6/if_youve_ever_wondered_what_its_like_after_death/)
