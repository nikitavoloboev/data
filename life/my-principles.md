# My principles
I believe everyone should have some set of principles they should follow. Having a clear picture of what is important to you and what you want to focus on doing in life is important.

Here are my mine :

1. Knowledge and education should be free for all
2. I should value each animal’s life on this planet as equal to that of my own
3. I should attempt to minimise suffering caused directly by me to other living organisms and the planet
4. I should be free to choose what I want to do and create
5. I should not judge any person’s actions and attempt to see their point of view in any action that they take
6. I should always challenge myself to do new things I have never tried before no matter how hard they seem
7. I want to make the world a fair place where all have a chance to create something creative and new
8. I want to visualise my ideas and knowledge and share these ideas with the world
9. I should embrace change 
10. I should not waste time doing things that don't impact my life in a positive way 
11. I should learn from my mistakes
12. I should behave in accordance to my principles
