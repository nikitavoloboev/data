# My principles

I believe everyone should have some set of principles they should follow. Having a clear picture of what is important to you and what you want to focus on doing in life is important.

Here are my principles :

 - knowledge and education should be free for all
- I should value each animal’s life on this planet as equal to that of my own
- I should attempt to minimise suffering caused directly by me to other living organisms and the planet
- I should attempt to minimise suffering caused directly by me to other living organisms and the planet
	- and behave in accordance to my principles
- I should be free to choose what I want to do and create
- I should not judge any person’s actions and attempt to see their point of view in any action that they take
- I should learn from my mistakes
- I want to make the world a fair place where all have a chance to create something creative and new
- I want to visualise my ideas and knowledge and share these ideas with the world
