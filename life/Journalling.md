# Journalling

Journalling my thoughts and experiences has seriously been my most impactful and healthy habit I started doing in my life.

Most of my journalling happens by writing in [my Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e) throughout every day. 

It helps me be mindful of what I am doing and keeps me in check for what my thoughts on my life are at any given time. I can be brutally honest with myself when writing there and for me its part of a cleansing process of bad and negative thoughts I feel.

If I ever feel down, I can just start writing and and just release all these negative thoughts onto paper. Many times, the simple act of writing makes you realise that these things I worry about are really silly and are either not in my control or simply not worth even being sad over.
