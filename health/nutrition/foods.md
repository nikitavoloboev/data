# Foods

I eat a whole food, place based diet and experiment by trying out new [vegan recipes](recipes.md). I exclude all unhealthy food.

Most of my diet consists of eating raw foods like almonds, walnuts, blueberries, bananas and avocados.

I try to cover my micro nutrient needs by consuming the same set of superfoods daily (NutriFull). Usually in form of a small smoothie or eaten raw after my [fast](fasting.md).

- Blueberries (200g+)
- Broccoli / Kale (50g+)
- Walnuts / Almonds (100g+)

Can be consumed in one go or throughout the day. This NutriFull also includes consuming few [supplements](supplements.md).

I use [Paprika app](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) to store all my recipes & the foods I can eat sorted into categories (with top first). Here is how it looks:
