# Foods

I eat a whole food, plant based diet and experiment by trying out new [vegan recipes](recipes.md). I exclude all unhealthy food.

Most of my diet consists of eating raw foods like various nuts (almonds, walnuts), blueberries, bananas and avocados.

I try to cover my micro & macro nutrient needs by consuming nutritious food & [supplementing](supplements.md). I sometimes make little smoothies to start off my day.

I nearly always keep nuts & fruits at hand as they make for healthy quick snacks.

I use [Paprika app](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) to store recipes of foods I love eating. I love finding new recipes and foods through traveling. I attach photos to all recipes (foods) even ones I don't know full instructions of how to make.

I also added a list of various plant based foods that I can use to experiment and cook with.
