# Health
I try to maximise my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) and quality of life through proper [nutrition](nutrition/nutrition.md), [exercise](../fitness/fitness.md) and stress free outlook with [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md).

Here are some things I am trying to improve with my health right now.

## Nutrition
I cover nutrition [here](nutrition/nutrition.md).

## Stress
Stress [shortens telomeres](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12114022). Practicing [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) helps greatly in maintaining a healthy and stress free outlook on life.

## Proper Sleep
I cover sleep [here](../sleep/sleep.md).

## Posture
I spend the most of my conscious time near my computer for better or worse. Thus I try to be concsious of my posture at all times.

## Dental care
Brushing my teeth every morning and evening as well as flossing it few times throughout the day.
