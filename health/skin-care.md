# Skin care

I use [Green Tea Seed Cleaning Foam](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/farm-stay-green-tea-seed-pure-cleansing-foam-180ml/info.html/pid.1044551497) for moisturizing my skin in morning/evening.

I wear sunblock when going out into sunny areas. And I never touch my face with dirty hands.

Frowning is also quite bad for your skin. So best thing you can do is be happy and smile.
