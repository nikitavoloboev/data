# Skin care

My morning skin routine consists of applying [Facial Oil-Free Cleanser](https://www.kiehls.com/gifts/customized-gifts/view-all-skincare/ultra-facial-oil-free-cleanser/1000.html) on my skin and gently washing it off. Afterwards, I gently apply [Facial Oil-Free Gel-Cream](https://www.kiehls.com/skincare/moisturizers/ultra-facial-oil-free-gel-cream/10003.html) on my skin and leave it on to moisturize my skin.

Upon leaving my home and going outside, I always apply my [SPF 50 Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.clinique.com/product/1661/40650/sun/sun-protection/spf-50-mineral-sunscreen-fluid-for-face) sunscreen on my face.

My evening skin routine is using cleanser followed by a moisturizer. Once a week, I also apply [Facial Overnight Hydrating Mask](https://www.kiehls.com/skincare/dry-skin/ultra-facial-overnight-hydrating-mask/3601.html) instead of my moisturizer and leave it on as I go to sleep.

I never touch my face with dirty hands and try to never frown and just smile.

I usually shave after a shower and use [Brushless Shave Cream](https://www.kiehls.com/body/hygiene-and-shave/ultimate-brushless-shave-cream---blue-eagle/235.html) to gently remove any unwanted hair, making sure not to leave off any scars in the process.
