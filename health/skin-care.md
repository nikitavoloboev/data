# Skin care

In the morning I apply [Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream Sunscreen SPF 30](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kiehls-Ultra-Facial-Cream-Sunscreen/dp/B01N788Z2A).

Before sleep I shower and apply [Kiehl's Ultra Facial Overnight Hydrating Masque](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kiehls-Facial-Overnight-Hydrating-Masque/dp/B008S5CV06) and use a clean towel on top of a pillow when sleeping.

I never touch my face with dirty hands and try to never frown & just smile.

I gently shave after shower and use [Brushless Shave Cream](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Brushless-Shave-Cream-Eagle/dp/B000S92RAY), making sure not to leave off any scars in the process.
