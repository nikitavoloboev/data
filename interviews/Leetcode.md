# Leetcode

I am currently practicing some Leetcode questions and writing my solutions in Go [here][1]. It has been quite fun trying to come up with solutions and experimenting with Go language in the process.

For the most part, I do struggle with coming up of solutions of my own and the many super optimised solutions in discussions amaze me with how someone could figure it out. But I think that comes with practice.
