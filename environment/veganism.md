# Veganism

I think it's mind numbing how animals can be treated by people. And how oblivious most people are to it all either mindfully or simply due to not being aware of the [consequences of their decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW6AgWPWRP4) (like buying some dead animal's meat) have. Watching a documentary like [Dominion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny6aqdFy9SI) should be enough to make you at least consider rethinking what food you eat. Thankfully whole food plant based diet is [genuinely a healthier diet](../health/nutrition/nutrition.md) too and there's so many fruits, vegetables and beans that you can choose to eat. I personally [love eating blueberries, avocados, walnuts and almonds](../health/nutrition/foods.md) and making [delicious vegan smoothies](../health/nutrition/recipes.md).

I hope more people wake up to this issue and it changes soon. Because animals should not be treated like that and especially at such scales. It's sad.

## Notes

- [If everyone in the world went to mostly plant-based (like the Okinawan traditional diet), it would be a MUCH better world. The positive impact would be huge. The impact on your health of having animal products only on special occasions would be minimal. I will tell you though, I've done that and when I've had beef after a long vegan run, it makes me sick to my stomach and I'm certain it's not merely psychological.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8x3tfm/is_100_vegan_the_way_to_go/)

- [The vegan diet, and veganism in general, is a plant-based diet, and an avoidance of all commodities made from animal products. Its focus is on cruelty to animals. WFPB is another plant-based diet, but with stricter recommendations, that you eat the healthiest of foods, and avoid processed and animal derived foods. I am vegan because I believe cruelty to the animals should be avoided, and I adhere to WFPB because I want to promote my health. Two different motivations that produce similar results with a lot of overlap.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/82lw2d/whats_the_difference_between_a_plantbased_and_a/)
