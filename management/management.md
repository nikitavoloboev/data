# Management

## Notes

- [As a CTO, my default loop is 'First, cycle through all my employees and make sure that I have equipped them to be happy and productive in their jobs. Second, find something to do. If possible, delegate it; if not, do it. Repeat.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16802530)
- Ideas are more important than age.
  - Just because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.
- [So much of good management is so simple: recognizing when your people need a challenge vs. when they need help.](https://twitter.com/jenistyping/status/1277466746400563200)
- [Review of Ted Lasso show and Ted's focus on making everyone in the team being the best version of themselves.](https://twitter.com/_danilo/status/1304811249499283456)
- [Do you need to estimate the shit that needs to be done? No! It all needs to be done. The dev team will do it as fast as they can. Estimating the work will only waste time they could spend getting the shit done.](http://slap.pm/)
- [It’s taken me years to realise I do not aspire to manage, only to mentor.](https://twitter.com/AlexJonesax/status/1374619459101544451)
- [Once a manager makes it clear they don’t value you, believe them. And move on.](https://twitter.com/editingemily/status/1376971156725637130)
