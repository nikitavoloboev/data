# Management

## Notes

- [As a CTO, my default loop is 'First, cycle through all my employees and make sure that I have equipped them to be happy and productive in their jobs. Second, find something to do. If possible, delegate it; if not, do it. Repeat.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16802530)
- Ideas are more important than age.
  - Just because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.
