# [ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC)
## ZNC commands
- `/quote detach ..` - will detach a channel from znc
	- i.e. `/quote detach ##graphics`
	- Pay attention to the slashes as they matter.
	- Connecting back is then simply `/join ..` (or connecting through Textual GUI click).

## Notes
- [Modules](https://wiki.znc.in/Modules) are quite interesting.
