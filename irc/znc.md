## Modules I use
- [Advanced ZNC playback](http://wiki.znc.in/Playback)
- [Mutter](https://wiki.znc.in/Mutter)

## ZNC commands
- `/quote detach ..` - will detach a channel from ZNC
	- i.e. `/quote detach ##graphics`
	- Pay attention to the slashes as they matter.
	- Connecting back is then simply `/join ..` (or connecting through Textual GUI click).
