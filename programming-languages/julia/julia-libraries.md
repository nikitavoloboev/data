# Julia libraries

## ML

- [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) - Elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support.
  - [Flux Model Zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo)

## Math

- [DifferentialEquations](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl) - Julia suite for high-performance solvers of differential equations.
- [IterativeSolvers](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl) - Iterative algorithms for solving linear systems, eigensystems, and singular value problems.
- [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) - Modeling language for Mathematical Optimization (linear, mixed-integer, conic, semidefinite, nonlinear).

## Biology

- [GeneticVariation](https://github.com/BioJulia/GeneticVariation.jl) - Data structures and algorithms for working with genetic variation.
