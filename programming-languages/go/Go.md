# Go
Go is currently my favourite language.

I mostly love the tooling around it like VS Code and its [Go plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go). The powerful  `go` command line tool and the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that people have built.

Go promotes composition over inheritance.

# Notes
- I can call functions from anywhere if they are in the same package.
