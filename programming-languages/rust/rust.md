# [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)

## Notes

- [Note that `cargo check` is faster than doing a full compile. Also I use the `rust-analyzer` language server for IDE integration to catch errors as I write them. Between the two, my workflow usually avoids the need for actually compiling a binary until I'm ready to run tests.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21759255)
- [Every reference in Rust has a lifetime, but the compiler is usually smart enough to infer it.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24294960)
- [Rust's key feature - the borrow-checker - relies on the idea that each value has a single "owner" at any given time. This owner can be a function, another value (a parent struct), etc. You can put these values on the heap, but if you use Box (the go-to for heap allocation), that pointer still has to have a single logical "owner". Under idiomatic Rust, each value effectively lives in one single "place". This allows the compiler to determine with 100% confidence at what point it's no longer being used and can therefore be de-allocated.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24991848)
  - Now, these values can be lent out ("borrowing") to sub-functions and such via references (mutable or immutable). Multiple immutable references can be handed out at once, but a mutable reference to a value has to be the only reference to that value of any kind, at a given time.
