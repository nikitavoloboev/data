# [React](https://reactjs.org)

## Notes

- Immediate mode simply means you specify what to redraw on every frame, there is no caching unless you specify it. And you basically redraw whenever some state changes (in a game this is going to be at frame rate).
  - In React, when some state changes, you respecify the DOM for components whose state has changed, but asynchronously the library determines how to make the DOM update more efficient on the next frame redraw.
- Retained-mode means you modify the scene graph (aka DOM) using imperative statements, it is difficult to keep your UI in sync with your models. With immediate-mode, you simply create a function f(m) over your model m to render it on each frame rate (which also often involves imperative instructions affecting the frame buffer, but the buffer can be cleared on each frame so who cares).
  - Retained-mode caches by default (often in opaque ways), which was the whole point (only re-render parts of the scene that have changed). You can roll your own caching for immediate mode, usually via some kind of invalidation scheme (use image for a node if nothing changed for this component, otherwise call that node's re-render method). On the other side, projects like React takes the retained-mode DOM and make it look more like an immediate-mode abstraction without sacrificing so much performance.
- The core premise for React is that UIs are simply a projection of data into a different form of data.
- [A React component is simply a JavaScript function that takes an object of arbitrary inputs known as props and returns React elements describing what should be rendered on the UI.](https://blog.logrocket.com/a-complete-guide-to-default-props-in-react-984ea8e6972d)
- Stateless components don't have `this`, just have props.
- [Is Concurrent Mode just a workaround for “virtual DOM diffing” overhead? Some people got that impression. Let me clarify why we’re working on it.](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1120971795425832961)
- [In order to write a very performant app there's only one golden rule: Make sure that your components are only re-rendered when necessary, and make sure that each render is fast](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/overstated#faq)
- Best use React in [strict mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html).
