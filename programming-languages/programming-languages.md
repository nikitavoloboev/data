# Programming languages

There is an [awesome article](https://briansteffens.github.io/2017/02/20/from-math-to-machine.html) that goes over how one program can be written in different languages from the most abstract level of Math to Haskell to C to Assembly to actual machine code.

## Notes

- [I have a very concrete approach for creating categorical models/semantics for PLs. I express the syntax as a GADT, wrap it with a free(r) monad, then work with the resulting kleisli category.](https://twitter.com/tangled_zans/status/1441434927149420547)
