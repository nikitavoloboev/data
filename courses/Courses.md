# Courses

I really love how websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) pioneered the abundance of free MOOCs by many awesome institutions and professors.

I have not taken many MOOCs so far but one I did take and quite liked was [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) although I really liked [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers?from_search=true) more as the course is also based on the book. 

You can take a look at the courses I am taking or planning to take soon [here](https://my.mindnode.com/uXZqWxUQsXMGnzbjgjNccxsVGgtxA6d9RsM7NsHB).
