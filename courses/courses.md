# Courses

I love how websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) pioneered the abundance of free MOOCs by many awesome institutions and professors.

I have not taken many MOOCs so far but one I did take and quite liked was [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). Although I liked [Mind for Numbers book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers) more. The course is also based on the book.
