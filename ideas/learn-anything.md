# [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz)

Learn Anything is currently the main project I am working on.

There is a lot of interesting things that still have to be done and since the project is fully [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything), all the communication and discussions about this project are done in the open so anyone interested can join in and help.

There is a lot of information included in the [readme](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything#readme). And there are lots of [curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme) available that are open to contribution.

Aside from providing links and connected topics to learn from. The end goal is to create a machine learning system that understands what you know and what you want to learn. It can then craft the most optimized path for learning a thing X based on what you know. And that X can be anything. Bash, math, history, macOS.

A kind of Netflix for learning. And as its open source too, anyone who knows how to code can literally add a feature themselves. And if they don't like the direction in which the website is going, they can fork it away.
