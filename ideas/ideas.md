# Ideas

I share all ideas of things I want to build in [Notion](../sharing/my-notion.md) as well as sharing [all the projects I am making or have made](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects).

Currently I am focusing my time on building [Learn Anything](learn-anything.md).

I try to give my full attention to any ideas I am working on.

- [Find a problem. Tell a story. Sell a service. Deliver a result. Build a product.](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1316747172306616321)
- [If your idea already exists it's validation that there's a market for it. If your execution of the same idea is 1) better, or 2) cheaper, you can reach customers in that market.](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1321428353811943424)
- [Make the first draft deliberately bad. It’s hard to write something good from nothing. But it’s easy to look at something and say “I can at least do better than this idiot.” Be the idiot. Then be better. Then be better again...](https://twitter.com/cahollenbeck/status/1327296301596352512)
