# Ideas

I share all ideas of things I want to build in a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) as well as sharing [all the projects I am making or have made](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects).

Currently I am focusing my time on building [Learn Anything](learn-anything.md).

I try to give my full attention to any ideas I am working on.
