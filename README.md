# [My Knowledge Wiki 📚](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz)
This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals in a lot of detail.

## Using the wiki well
In the left corner you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

You can access any entry from this wiki super fast using [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) workflow.

Aside from this wiki, you can also explore [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) for things that you can learn about.

## Other things I wrote and shared
I share my knowledge in a longer form by [writing articles](sharing/my-articles.md) and making [YouTube videos](sharing/my-youtube.md).

I also love writing code that solves various problems I have and I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev).
