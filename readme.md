<h1 align="center">My Knowledge Index 💡</h1>

<h1 align="center"> Description 📕</h1>

Inspired by [this][1]. I want to keep my own version of a knowledge index that both I and other people can search over and use.

Unlike [my mind maps][2] and [Alfred My Mind][3] that searches over these mind maps. I want this to be a more official knowledge index and a reference for things I know that I find useful to reference back to.

My focus at current time is learning Programming in Go, macOS automation with JXA, Alfred, Keyboard Maestro and scripting plus learning more about the web and its implications. 

<h1 align="center"> Using the Search Well 🔍</h1>

In the left corner you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

Aside from this, you can of course also explore [Learn Anything][4] for things that you can learn about and I will often reference it from these notes.

You can also take some time to explore [my personal mind map of notes and links][5] that I use for my own personal productivity and research. It is of course a bit more chaotic as its made for my own personal use.

This Index however is targeted to be read and understood by other people easily so feel free to explore it. 

I also share my knowledge in a longer form by [writing articles][6] and making [YouTube videos][7].

<h1 align="center"> Abbreviations 🔖</h1>

I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean : 

- LA = [Learn Anything][8] (will often link to a map there for learning some topic)

	 
<h1 align="center"> Thanks 🍀</h1>

You can support what I do on [Patreon][9] or look [into other repositories][10] I shared. Thank you. 💛
