# My Knowledge Index 📚
This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals in a lot of detail.

## Using the Wiki Well 
In the left corner you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

Aside from this, you can of course also explore [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) for things that you can learn about and I will often reference it from these notes.

You can access any entry from this wiki super fast using my [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) workflow which alongside this wiki here, also searches through [various mind maps I've made](./meta/my-mind.md).

## Other things I wrote and shared 
I share my knowledge in a longer form by [writing articles](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and making [YouTube videos](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-youtube).

I also love writing code that solves various problems I have and I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev). [Here](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) you can find the things I have made and shared thus far.

For more things I have shared, you can look [here](./sharing/sharing.md).

## Make your own wiki 
You can view other similar to this, continuously updated wikis, [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge). 

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
