<h1 align="center">My Knowledge Index 💡</h1>
<h1 align="center"> Description 📕</h1>

Inspired by [this](https://yoshuawuyts.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/). I want to keep [my own version of a knowledge index](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) that both I and other people can search over and use.

<h1 align="center"> Using the Wiki Well 🔍</h1>

In the left corner you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals in a lot of detail.

Aside from this, you can of course also explore [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) for things that you can learn about and I will often reference it from these notes.

You can access any entry from this wiki super fast using my [Alfred My Mind]() workflow which alongside this wiki here, also searches through [various mind maps I've made](./meta/my-mind.md).

<h1 align="center"> Other things I wrote and shared 📚</h1>

I share my knowledge in a longer form by [writing articles](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and making [YouTube videos](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-youtube).

I also love writing code that solves various problems I have and I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev). [Here](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) you can find the things I have made and shared thus far.

For more things I have shared, you can look [here](./sharing/sharing.md).

<h1 align="center"> Make your own wiki 📓</h1>

You can view other similar to this continuously updated wikis and knowledge bases [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge). 

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world. 

<h1 align="center"> Thanks 🍀</h1>
