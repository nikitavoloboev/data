# [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
The best text editing experience you will ever get. It is worth learning it as you will start thinking about text editing differently.

I use some kind of vim bindings in any app I use and if there is a vim plugin for the app, I often use it.

I use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) instead of vim and my vimrc for it can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/init.vim).

## Notes
- I can profile vim startup time with [this](https://github.com/tweekmonster/startuptime.vim).
- I can run `:CheckHealth` to see if there is anything wrong with my installation (only Neovim).
- Get plugins that meet your needs.
- You're more likely to find useful plugins if you approach it the other way around: I want to do X, vim can't really do it nicely by itself, which plugin can help me do it.
- If something doesn't work in vimrc, put the binding in the bottom of vimrc (perhaps something overrides it).
