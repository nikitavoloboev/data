# [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Don't use it any more as I don't write Java and love VS Code.

## Nice plugins

- [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) - Vim mode.
- [Monokai Theme](https://darekkay.com/blog/monokai-theme-intellij/) - Most similar to [Monokai Night](../design/monokai-night-themes.md). Although if I did use IntelliJ, I would port Monokai Night fully.

## Links

- [Alabaster IDEA Color Scheme](https://github.com/tonsky/intellij-alabaster) - Simple white theme.
