# [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
Don't write a lot of Java but the IDE is amazing.

I use [Ayu colour scheme](https://github.com/jesse-c/ayu-jetbrains) together with [IdeaVim plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as my font.
