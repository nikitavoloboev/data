# Text editors

Vim, Sublime Text and VS code are my favorite editors.

Vim for its text editing and the _vim language_ and VS code for giving me the best of both worlds. The awesome [Vim plugin](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) and the amazing IDE like features. And Sublime Text for its speed and the awesome [vim emulation](https://github.com/guillermooo/Six).
