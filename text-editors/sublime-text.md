Started using this editor in addition to VS Code and neovim for its blazing fast speed of opening files.

I know always keep it open full screen with my .dotfiles folder open there :

I also use it to quickly edit certain config files like [adding more web searches][1], adding more maps to parse for Alfred My Mind or editing and adding maps for LA itself.
