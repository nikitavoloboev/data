# Music

I love listening to different music. My favorite genres are ambient, electronic, instrumental and Psybient.

You can listen through a lot of the songs I liked on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/you/likes). And I share a lot of [playlists](music-playlists.md) and [music artists](music-artists.md) I love.

You can also see my most listened to [artists](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/library/artists), [songs](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/library/tracks) and [albums](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/library/albums) alongside my [yearly music stats](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/listening-report/year).
