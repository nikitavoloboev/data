# Music playlists

## Spotify

I made and share a lot of [my Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev). I love my [Bliss](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev/playlist/2N82DnDsPGMnpJhN8sVFJu?si=JfYPAzAcT0qyvJI08KEg2g) playlist the most.

## YouTube

I also share a [big playlist of all the music I like](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) on YouTube.

## SoundCloud

I love exploring the rich library of music on SoundCloud. I share all the music I liked on [my profile](https://soundcloud.com/nikitavoloboev).
