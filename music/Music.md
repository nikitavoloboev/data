# Music

I love listening to different music. Although my favourite genres are ambient, electronic and instrumental, I love quite a lot of songs from many different genres.

You can listen through a lot of the songs I liked on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) and I made and shared a lot of [my personal Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev).

Currently I am really liking and listing to [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev/playlist/4pRiHQwLoSc8MQ23swgts8) a lot.
