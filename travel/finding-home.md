# Finding homes

I use [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com) & [Booking](https://www.booking.com) for finding temporary places to stay when traveling.

I use various FB groups / [Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) for finding more permanent places to stay in when traveling. As well as a couple of websites.

### UK

- [SpareRoom](https://www.spareroom.co.uk)
- [Gumtree](https://gumtree.com/)
- [OpenRent](https://www.openrent.co.uk/)
- [RightMove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/)

### NL

- [I am expat](https://www.iamexpat.nl)
- [Only Expats](https://www.onlyexpats.nl/)
- [Funda](https://www.funda.nl)
- [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com)
- [HousingAnywhere](https://housinganywhere.com/)

## Notes

- For putting the place up for rent goes through the same websites. Make nice photos, add nice description. Upload it on FB Marketplace and cross post it to all the relevant rent/sell groups. As well as post on other sites like SpareRoom for extra exposure.
