# Finding homes

I use [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com) & [Booking](https://www.booking.com) for finding temporary places to stay when traveling.

I use [FB groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/) / [Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) for finding/selling places to stay in.

### UK

- [SpareRoom](https://www.spareroom.co.uk)
- [Gumtree](https://gumtree.com/)
- [OpenRent](https://www.openrent.co.uk/)
- [RightMove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/)
- [Wayhome](https://www.wayhome.co.uk/) - Home ownership with a 5% deposit.

### NL rent

- [Holland2Stay](https://holland2stay.com/)
- [I am expat](https://www.iamexpat.nl)
- [Only Expats](https://www.onlyexpats.nl/)
- [Funda](https://www.funda.nl)
- [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com)
- [HousingAnywhere](https://housinganywhere.com/)

## Notes

- For putting the place up for rent goes through the same websites. Make nice photos, add nice description. Upload it on FB Marketplace and cross post it to all the relevant rent/sell groups. As well as post on other sites like SpareRoom for extra exposure.
