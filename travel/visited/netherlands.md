## Notes

- NS.nl [season tickets](https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets) are must have if you plan to travel more than a few times on the train in the month.
  - Dal Voordeel (40 % discount on weekends + 40 % discount off peak) is great general discount.
  - Dal Vrij (unlimited weekend + unlimited off peak hours) is great if you travel very often (i.e. work in one city and live in another).
- Heath insurance is mandatory. I use [cz.nl](https://www.cz.nl) cheapest plan they have although I regret not getting an even [cheaper one from different provider](https://www.zilverenkruis.nl/English/insurances/national-healthcare-insurance/Paginas/default.aspx).
- UWV (unemployment) benefits. [werk.nl](https://www.werk.nl/werk_nl/werknemer/home). [uwv.nl](https://www.uwv.nl/particulieren/). Need to work certain number of hours in a year to be qualified for the benefits. Submit income statement first of every month on [uwv.nl](https://www.uwv.nl/particulieren/formulieren/invullen-inkomstenopgave.aspx). Need to show applications to 5 jobs every 4 weeks ([Uw sollicitatieactiviteiten doorgeven](https://digid.werk.nl/werk_nl/werknemer/mijn_werkmap/doorgeven/taken)). Can always arrange meeting or message for help on werk.nl website
