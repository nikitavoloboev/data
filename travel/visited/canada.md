# Canada

## Notes

- [Canada has got to be the best country on earth to be self-employed in. Basically zero bureaucracy (don’t even have to register, just start invoicing people), completely free healthcare, and very fair taxes in comparison to other more socialized countries.](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1276299742276915200)
