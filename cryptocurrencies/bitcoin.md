# [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)

Bitcoin is a [complete environmental disaster](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1350869944888664064). [Nano](nano.md) is the future of decentralized currency.

## Notes

- [Bitcoin is both trust-minimized (even more than gold) yet quite unlike gold digital & easily transferable in its trust-minimized form. It's an unprecedentedly superior form of money, but like anything else new traded in a free market, its historical journey starts off volatile.](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1328759197769502722)
- [At this point, of all the things Bitcoin can do that other financial assets can't (pseudo-anonymous, extremely hard to confiscate, can be moved quasi instantaneously across borders, demonstrably finite supply, can be use as a settlement layer for large players, etc ...) the one aspect that I believe attracts people is "store of value". Many people contest that last property citing high volatility, and they're correct if your window is less than 4 years. But for folks who play the long game, supply and demand tells a very compelling story for Bitcoin.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25157946)
