# Cryptocurrencies

I think [Solana](../databases/blockchain/solana.md)/[Tezos](../databases/blockchain/tezos.md)/[NEAR](../databases/blockchain/near.md)/[AVAX](https://www.avax.network/)/[Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/) are great [distributed consensus systems for transacting assets and running code](https://twitter.com/levie/status/1461099049461981189) ([smart contracts](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-solana-smart-contract/)). And I find [stable coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin) (tokens that are pegged to another 'real world currency') and privacy coins/contracts ([Monero](monero.md)/[SRCT](https://scrt.network/)/[IronFish](https://ironfish.network/)) to be most interesting use cases of crypto right now.

It's unfortunate that a lot of people/projects use these distributed ledgers as [ponzi schemes](https://twitter.com/eddyb_r/status/1451679543702478860) or [wash trading](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1461301086363529219) or still use [super wasteful consensus systems](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1350869944888664064) (like [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md)).

I use [FTX](https://ftx.com/referrals#a=58425911) as my preferred crypto exchange that lets me trade between FIAT/crypto.

## Notes

- [The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. What actually matters is making goods & providing services. We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. Whichever has least error & latency will win.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704)
- [China launches digital yuan. Adopted by nations tired of SWIFT abuse. Suddenly US can’t impose sanctions. Shift from apathy to panic, like COVID. But DC can’t build. So they deputize private USD stablecoins. And that is how a digital dollar may be born.](https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1395722987966455811)
- [Rich people buy tons very low and wait till it rises high sell all for tons of profit...Then retail investors get scared and sell there coins making it drop way further than what the rich guys took profit...Next they buy tons again at a even cheaper price and get a lot more coins for there money...Rises high again then Repeat......Vicious cycle but this is the little guys opportunity to get a leg up. Why we have to hold for years of cycles like this and then we lil guys come out on top.](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/prndpj/whats_going_on_with_the_whole_crypto_market/)
- [Message to US and Western Policymakers on how to think about China's approach to crypto and blockchain. China opposes the Western system of values built on openness, transparency, privacy, free market competition and so forth.](https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1441455390982479878)
- [Chains that charge users more than 2-4x the bandwidth it takes to replicate a tx will fail.](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1441904517939810313)
- [Use a hardware wallet.](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante/status/1444023272836775937)
- [One of the most obvious flaws in using blockchains for anything involving regular human beings is one I've not seen much discussion of: Regular human beings cannot protect their passwords, credentials or private keys. They just can't. The idea of encouraging anyone who doesn't have a deep understanding of personal information security to attach a sizable portion of their net worth to an irreversible "code is law" distributed system is utterly appalling.](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1444071543902912513)
- [Mercury Bank is great for dealing with DeFi, crypto, or NFTs](https://twitter.com/BankMercury/status/1453765293214474242)
- [Even if tokens are securities, they are securities that fix everything the SEC has ruined in the public markets: 1. Networks launch before all value creation is captured by VCs. 2. Democratic ownership and user ownership and contributor ownership. 3. Fixes problems with stock options.](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1459497183217164290)
- [One crypto application I'm fully convinced by is decentralized money: Money the government can't touch.](https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1462138666520883208)
