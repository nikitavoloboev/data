# Zsh
My shell of choice. My config for it can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh).

## Notes
- Exported variables get passed on to child processes. Non-exported variables do not.
- I don't need to add `function` text before function definition.
- Search `zshall` man page to find all zsh widgets and more things.
