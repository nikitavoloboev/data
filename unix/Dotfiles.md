# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are all the hidden settings and configuration files you have on your unix system.
  
I wrote a bit on how you can set up and start customising your shell from scratch as well as how to set up a dotfiles folder and share it on GitHub [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/pretty-and-fast-shell-97ea870f2805).

My own dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles). They are always in that state of flux. But I am learning and adapting things as I go. I also document my dotfiles repo structure as a map [here](https://my.mindnode.com/3EfbezxGu7xVAM4GQNuN8Lq1naudqs333HqgTuDj).
