# Humans
Being a human myself, I can't but be amazed and inspired by what other people have both created before me and are creating right now.

I have many interests and I find studying and looking into people who have spent their time studying some of these topics is a really good investment of my time. It's also quite amazing that nowadays you can potentially message a person whose work you like and sometimes they can respond.

I maintain a list of [all the interesting humans across all the different disciplines](https://github.com/learn-anything/humans#interesting-humans-).
