# Learn anything
[Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) is currently my main project I am working on.

There is a lot of interesting things that still have to be done and since the project is fully [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything), all the communication and discussions about this project are done in the open so anyone interested can join in and help.

There is a lot of information included in the [wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki).

And there is lots of [curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#curated-lists) available that are open to contribution.
