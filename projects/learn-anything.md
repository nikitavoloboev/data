# Learn anything
[Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) is currently my main project I am working on.

There is a lot of interesting things that still have to be done and since the project is fully Open Source, all the communication and discussions about this project are done in the open so anyone interested can join in and help.

There is a lot of information included in the [wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps/wiki) and [our blog](http://blog.learn-anything.xyz/).
