# Chess

Loved watching [Queen's Gambit](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-queen-s-gambit). I play on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) & enjoy watching [great chess games](https://lichess.org/games) & listening to game analysis. [Mikhail Tal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnx7w_xuguGl3y2Utxhp6eAKi9KhVlcx), [Daniil Dubov](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=daniil+dubov) &
[Teimour Radjabov](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeimourRadjabovChess/videos) games are joy to watch.
