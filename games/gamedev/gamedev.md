## Notes

- Programming is about solving problems. Programming a game isn't really any different. I start by thinking what problem is this game going to solve, as well as what other games might already do that. For example if I was making a physics puzzle game I would also consider "Why aren't they just playing Portal instead of this?" And go from there.
- ["Mod" culture in gaming is an incredibly powerful, creative force that is responsible for nearly all popular games today. It allows non-technical users to tinker, create, and distribute to an engaged, pre-installed user base.](https://twitter.com/cpaik/status/1270824271204532226)
