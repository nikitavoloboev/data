# Game development

## OSS Games

- [LSD](https://github.com/franzenzenhofer/lsd) - Line-square-dot: an addicting game.
- [Dino Jump](https://github.com/dj/dinojump)

## Notes

- Programming is about solving problems. Programming a game isn't really any different. I start by thinking what problem is this game going to solve, as well as what other games might already do that. For example if I was making a physics puzzle game I would also consider "Why aren't they just playing Portal instead of this?" And go from there.
