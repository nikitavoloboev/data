## Notes

- Programming is about solving problems. Programming a game isn't really any different. I start by thinking what problem is this game going to solve, as well as what other games might already do that. For example if I was making a physics puzzle game I would also consider "Why aren't they just playing Portal instead of this?" And go from there.
