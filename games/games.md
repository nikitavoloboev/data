# Games

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/EekGabpj) of games I am playing now or want to play. And I made a list of [awesome games](https://github.com/learn-anything/games#readme) you can play.

I track all the games I have played [here](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi).

## Favorite games

I keep a [list of all my favorite games](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/shelves/53363-favorite/). Below are some games that really left an impression on me and why.

- [Dune 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000) - Loved this game. Probably the first strategy game I fell in love with.
- Stronghold 2001 - The campaign was super hard and interesting. I loved building little worlds with superficial economies. Was super fun.
- [The Curse of Monkey Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_Monkey_Island) - Was fun exploring the game and solving puzzles.
- [Diablo II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II) - The first RPG I fell in love with. Many great memories from the game.
- [Warcraft III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos) - Probably the best multiplayer game I ever played. The amount of amazing and creative modes that came out of the game's world builder is immense. DOTA came from Warcraft III initially.
- [Command & Conquer: Generals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Generals) - An awesome real time strategy game.
- [Cossacks: European Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks:_European_Wars) - An awesome real time strategy game.
- [League of Legends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends) - Speaking of DOTA, whilst I haven't played original DOTA much, I did love League. Have many fond memories of playing with my friends. Many people take the game too seriously and ruin the fun both for themselves and other people but if you play with friends and just have fun, the game is quite amazing.
