# Advice
Some advice I received and liked or read in some place.

## Vim
- Get plugins that meet your needs.
- You're more likely to find useful plugins if you approach it the other way around: I want to do X, vim can't really do it nicely by itself, which plugin can help me do it.
- If something doesn't work in vimrc, put the binding in the bottom of vimrc (perhaps something overrides it).

## Talks
- Giving a talk, follow:
	1. Why?
	2. How?
	3. What?
	- Is more powerful than the other way around
