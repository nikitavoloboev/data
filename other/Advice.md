# Advice
Some advice I received and liked or read in some place.

## Vim
- Get plugins that meet your needs
- If something doesn't work in vimrc, put the binding in the bottom of vimrc (perhaps something overrides it)

## Talks
- Giving a talk, follow:
	1. Why?
	2. How?
	3. What?
	- Is more powerful than the other way around
