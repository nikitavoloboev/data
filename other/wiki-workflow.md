# My workflow in writing and maintaining this wiki

The entire wiki is one folder that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge). It has many folders with subfolders or entries inside.

The order with which GitBook renders the files in the sidebar to your left is defined in [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).

I write and edit all the markdown files in this wiki from [Sublime Text](../text-editors/sublime-text/sublime-text.md) with [Vim mode](https://github.com/guillermooo/Six).

I use [this Alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows#personal-workflows) to quickly search through all the `.md` files that are found in this wiki.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JUMpYzb.png)

This workflow also searches through all folders in this wiki and lets me create new folders inside those folders or create new entries (md files) inside the folders.

I also wrote a [comment that goes in more detail over the ways I update the wiki](https://lobste.rs/s/e5lx5p/what_note_taking_team_wiki_personal_wiki#c_vczr1n).

## Editing on iOS

I place this [knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) folder in Dropbox. Then I use [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com) iOS app to edit this entire wiki from the app by adding it as an external folder. Ulysses indexes the entire wiki so I can jump to any file in the folder in seconds and make an edit.

I can't however push changes live from iOS so I do that from mac.

## Making notes on books

When reading books, I annotate over the PDF with [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com). Once I read the book I transfer the annotations to the markdown file and connect the file to wiki. Then write a review on Goodreads and add the review and notes I made to [books](../books/books.md).

## Using this wiki

Now that I can edit this wiki and extend it at the speed of a thought. I can open any of the wiki entries in seconds by searching for the file I need with [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).

![](https://i.imgur.com/vRtsNbq.png)

And anyone who owns Alfred can download the workflow and search through the wiki too. Outside of that, GitBook also provides a pretty neat search in the wiki itself. In there you can make textual queries too and files where the queried text is will be shown.
