# Negotiating

## Notes

- [Start off with a strong position, then negotiate back to the place where you want it to be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/5qtyh1/as_a_british_citizen_that_was_born_in_iraq_is/dd29nmy/)
- In short:
  1. Know what result you want.
  2. Propose your result + a ton of wild unreasonable additions.
  3. Your opponent gets all disheveled by the unreasonable additions.
  4. You 'compromise' by walking back to what you want. You opponent gets a win and you get what you wanted all along.

- My current compensation is part of the reason why am looking into other opportunities.
