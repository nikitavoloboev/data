# [Governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance)

## Notes

- [Digital technology is separating the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers and the watched.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook)
- [Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us. Once we thought of digital services as free, but now surveillance capitalists think of us as free.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook)
- [It is no longer enough to automate information flows about us; the goal now is to automate us. These processes are meticulously designed to produce ignorance by circumventing individual awareness and thus eliminate any possibility of self-determination. As one data scientist explained to me, “We can engineer the context around a particular behaviour and force change that way… We are learning how to write the music, and then we let the music make them dance.”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook)
- [Coordination, the ability for large groups of actors to work together for their common interest, is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It can be improved in many ways:](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html)
  - Faster spread of information.
  - Better norms that identify what behaviors are classified as cheating along with more effective punishments.
  - Stronger and more powerful organizations.
  - Tools like smart contracts that allow interactions with reduced levels of trust.
  - Governance technologies (voting, shares, decision markets...)
- [If there is a blockchain based mobile voting App (with proper KYC of course), we won't have to wait for results, or have any questions on its validity. Privacy can be protected using a number of encryption mechanisms.](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1324179944558059522)
- [The "capitalism <-> socialism" opposition seems outdated. I prefer to think in terms of "centralization vs decentralization". Humans have evolved to perform best in small groups of less than 150 people. That's why wherever there's centralization and excessive heirarchy, there's inefficiency and underutilized human potential. Capitalist monopolies and socialist dictatorships are equally bad.](https://t.me/durov/151)
- I think every citizen should have ability to live off the grid without having to pay any tax if he/she wants to. There should be tools available to grow your own food with ease in any environment. Purchases should be conducted in a global decentralized untraceable cryptocurrency. And there should be systems built where fraud (stealing) cannot happen from the government. Full accountability.
