# Podcasts
I love listening to podcasts with [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) especially when commuting or travelling somewhere.

My favourite podcasts currently are [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm), [StackTrace](https://stacktracepodcast.fm/) and [Tim Ferris Show](https://overcast.fm/itunes863897795/the-tim-ferriss-show).

I would love to make my own podcast one day once I find something interesting to talk about.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Wtr04eGQ) of podcasts I am listening and want to listen to.

## Favourite episodes
- [Incremental Correctness (feat. Guillermo Rauch)](https://spectrum.chat/thread/e3e27c4b-2a80-4a44-a5d8-c23ab07a7b06)
- [Type Driven Development and Idris With Edwin Brady](https://corecursive.com/006-type-driven-development-and-idris-with-edwin-brady)

## Interesting episodes
- [James Long - Seeking Deep Knowledge](http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-329-james-long-seeking-deep-knowledge)

## Notes
- A podcast is just people talking. Nothing magical.
- Can use QuickTime to record.
- Great opportunity to meet up with others - makes for a more fun show.
- Since it's a rather new format, there's lots of room for new concepts and new ideas.
- You don't need expensive recording studio. It's just recording conversations.
- Basic audio editing is easy to learn. You can use free tools like GarageBand and Audacity.
- Podcasts are not necessarily live. You can edit out the parts that go off topic.
