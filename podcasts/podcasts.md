- Since it's a rather new format, there's lots of room for new concepts and new ideas.
- You don't need expensive recording studio. It's just recording conversations.
- Basic audio editing is easy to learn. You can use free tools like GarageBand and Audacity.
- Podcasts are not necessarily live. You can edit out the parts that go off topic.
