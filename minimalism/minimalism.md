# Minimalism
I love to live minimally and only use what I need. Think about things that matter to me. Cutting out the noise and focusing on what's important to me. I love cutting out any kind of distractions from my life. I love not keeping everything in my head and letting software and tools do the things they are good at. Storing and retrieving information. Events, todos, tasks and projects.

I try to focus on one task a time. Finished the task? Do the next one in the queue. Task too difficult? [Slice it and break it down to smaller tasks I can work on](../research/solving-problems.md). One by one. No extra thinking of whether I am doing the right thing right now or whether I should be focusing my time on something else. Full focus on the task at hand until it is done.

I practice this art of minimising and focusing on what's important to me & removing everything that is not every single day.

## Possessions
I have a private Trello board where I list things I own in my life. I mark items that I no longer need with `Sell` tag as well as items I need to upgrade with `Upgrade`. I try to make sure that the items I do own fit into one backpack so I can move between to any place in the world with no effort.

Here is how that board looks for me:

## Notes
- [Will this item provide value? If not, get rid of it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/846drx/extreme_minimalism_a_trend/)
- I've found the easiest stuff to organize is the stuff I no longer have.
