# Communication

## Notes

- [Never underestimate the impact of informal positive feedback on a junior, career-changer or someone new to the stack. Often people just need to know they're on the right road.](https://twitter.com/thomas_k_r/status/1296015993144332288)
- [At the end of each meeting ask if they know anyone else you can meet with. I normally tell them I’m trying to expand my network with successful folks in the area/space. Nice way to indirect compliment them.](https://twitter.com/AlwaysBeHustlin/status/1297920306900865024)
- [Trust your people. Simplify and then simplify again. If you don’t trust your team to present complex concepts in a simple manner, the whole system breaks. Don’t use 10 words when you can use one.](https://twitter.com/Post_Market/status/1313098213625393157)
- [Remember that almost no conversation ends with a change of mind. That happens later, if at all.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24968437)
- [Bell ran a study to find out what the most productive engineers did differently from their peers. The answer was communication. They did a lot more of it. They bounced ideas with co-workers, they validated solutions with customers, they did their own research, and so on.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25030938)
- [The key to success is overcommunicating.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25120207)
- [Pay attention to who you have the highest-bandwidth conversations with (i.e., important ideas are exchanged quickly and clearly). Work with those people any way you can.](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1333491951249760256)
