# Communication

## Notes

- [Never underestimate the impact of informal positive feedback on a junior, career-changer or someone new to the stack. Often people just need to know they're on the right road.](https://twitter.com/thomas_k_r/status/1296015993144332288)
- [At the end of each meeting ask if they know anyone else you can meet with. I normally tell them I’m trying to expand my network with successful folks in the area/space. Nice way to indirect compliment them.](https://twitter.com/AlwaysBeHustlin/status/1297920306900865024)
- [Trust your people. Simplify and then simplify again. If you don’t trust your team to present complex concepts in a simple manner, the whole system breaks. Don’t use 10 words when you can use one.](https://twitter.com/Post_Market/status/1313098213625393157)
- [Remember that almost no conversation ends with a change of mind. That happens later, if at all.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24968437)
- [Bell ran a study to find out what the most productive engineers did differently from their peers. The answer was communication. They did a lot more of it. They bounced ideas with co-workers, they validated solutions with customers, they did their own research, and so on.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25030938)
- [The key to success is overcommunicating.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25120207)
- [Pay attention to who you have the highest-bandwidth conversations with (i.e., important ideas are exchanged quickly and clearly). Work with those people any way you can.](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1333491951249760256)
- [Respect and honesty are the foundation layer that all human contact is built upon. Whatever the situation and whoever we're talking to, let's offer respect, and let's be deserving of people's trust. Offline or online, it doesn't matter.](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1340859937782697986)
- [I’ve learned that when I have a positive thought about someone, it’s generally worth communicating it. If I think a coworker saved me on some project, I tell them. If my partner is making me feel warm and fuzzy, I tell her. If someone impresses me, I say so. I don’t think people express these things nearly as often as they feel them, and I expect that many of the positive things that do end up communicated have another motive behind them. Simple earnest positive comments are very much worthwhile.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25551487)
- [Most people do not listen with the intent to understand, they listen with the intent to reply.](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1353760808191180801)
- [My love language is direct feedback and clear next steps.](https://twitter.com/NatashaVianna/status/1367159598390550528)
- [If you see something you love online, maybe consider emailing the person and letting them know! Worst case, they’ll ignore it, best case, you’ll forget about it and then be pleasantly surprised when they answer](https://capnfabs.net/posts/2020-its-over/)
- [Never expect or require someone to get back to you immediately unless it’s a true emergency. The expectation of immediate response is toxic.](https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1371587706782851072)
- [Best calls I've had for months have been audio walk-and-talks and I love them.](https://twitter.com/superbryntendo/status/1376606058467188747)
- [The gross thing about assuming all women in tech are dealing with impostor syndrome is that lots of men take it as permission to position themselves as your mentor rather than your peer.](https://twitter.com/amyngyn/status/1381416143684915207)
- [My favorite question anyone asks me when I am struggling is, 'Do you want empathy or strategy right now?'](https://twitter.com/noampomsky/status/1382117707588456450)
- [The business world now works like this: 1. If I don't know you > Zoom. 2. If I know you a bit > Email. 3. If we really work together / collaborate > Text.](https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1383534481705865221)
