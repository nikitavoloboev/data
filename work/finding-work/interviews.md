## Notes

- [Never think that a job interview is a one-way interview. At least, personally, I always am interviewing the potential team as well. No, you don't have all the control as the interviewer.](https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/989878115710263297)
- [Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has developed an "Alternative Interview Framework" that involves:](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1079502682807664640)
  - 2 interviewers at a time
  - sharing questions with candidates ahead of time
  - working on actual problems the team is facing
  - blind feedback
- When trying to solve problems for understanding, don't blindly copy other's solutions. Read their solutions and take notes. Then reimplement from the notes.
- [In my experience the best candidates speculate rather than giving up, ask appropriate clarifying questions, and take end-to-end ownership of each answer by synthesising disparate discussion into a coherent final explanation.](https://twitter.com/kieranmch/status/1215385877112815617)
